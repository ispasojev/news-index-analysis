The tunnel and an adjacent Cross Bay Link will be launched on December 11, with five bus routes using the tunnel immediately and another four being added later. The government says it expects travel times between Tseung Kwan O and Kowloon East to be reduced by 20 minutes. 

Speaking on an RTHK programme, Ms Fong welcomed the new links, saying traffic congestion in Tseung Kwan O was horrible.

The existing tunnel was originally designed for 78,000 vehicles per day, she said. It now sees up to almost 100,000 vehicles per day, which is why there are such long queues. The traffic right now is quite horrible. There are always traffic jams from Kowloon East all the way up to the Kwun Tong highway.

File photo: Shutterstock The government said it vehemently refutes a report by a US congressional committee, saying its comments were slanderous and ill intentioned. 

It also urged the United States to stop maliciously interfering in Hong Kong affairs. 

In a statement issued early on Wednesday, the government said the United States China Economic and Security Review Commission had again made up excuses which deviate from the facts to maliciously slander the National Security Law. It said all actions by law enforcement agencies were evidenced based and law abiding. Meanwhile, the SAR had an independent judiciary, and the government was firmly committed to upholding the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents. 

The government also defended electoral changes that ensure patriots administer Hong Kong. It said no one in any region in the world would allow political power to fall into the hands of forces who betray their own country. It described recent Legco and Chief Executive elections as open, fair and honest, demonstrating broad representation, and political inclusiveness.

The government said it also strongly opposed false ideas in the US report concerning the school curriculum of Chinese History and Citizenship and Social Development, saying the subjects aimed to broaden students' horizons, develop their critical thinking, and cultivate their sense of national identity. It said the related textbooks stated that Hong Kong was never a colony and an indisputable fact that Hong Kong had been part of China's territory since ancient times. 

The government also rejected criticism of China and its Covid strategy. It said China was among the countries with the lowest Covid prevalence and death rate, while the US had the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths. It noted that the latter's vaccination rate was much lower than Hong Kong's.

The US bipartisan report accused security authorities here of continuing what they described as an 'assault' on Hong Kong's freedoms, and said the economy suffered from restrictions guided by Beijing. 

It said stronger mainland influence over Hong Kong was driving key changes to all aspects of life in the territory and more emigration. 

The US report also said the SAR government was moving to a legal system that increasingly mimicked that of the mainland, threatening prospects for journalists and civil society, as well as foreign businesses and expatriates here.";Radio Television Hong Kong

The new 3.8 kilometre connection and the adjacent Cross Bay Link, a 1.8 kilometre bridge, will open on December 11.

The authorities said they picked five bus routes, which will start service from December 12, for the new HK$15 billion tunnel. They added the five routes will only operate during peak hours on weekdays for now. 

There are two stages to introduce bus routes via [the] Tseung Kwan O Lam Tin Tunnel, explained Honson Yuen, an assistant commissioner for transport. 

He said these buses will travel between Tseung Kwan O and Tai Po, Cheung Sha Wan, Sham Shui Po, Tsuen Wan and the Yau Tsim Mong area.

He added that four more bus routes will use the new tunnel later. 

We'll look at the traffic situation to decide [the] exact timing to introduce the four routes going via [the] Tseung Kwan O Lam Tin Tunnel in the second stage, said Yuen, who added that additional bus services may be available in future depending on the views of the local community and traffic situation. 

The HK$5.6 billion Cross Bay Link is the first viaduct that features carriageways, bicycle tracks and footpaths in Hong Kong. 

Authorities say they expect the new transport link can divert up to 40 percent of the vehicles from the current Tseung Kwan O Tunnel and cut the transport time between Tseung Kwan O and Kowloon Bay by 20 minutes during peak hours.";Radio Television Hong Kong

But questions remain about why the song, associated with violent protests in Hong Kong in 2019, ended up in a folder where all national anthems were stored. 

The song was played as the Hong Kong sevens team prepared to play hosts South Korea in Sunday's final of the second leg of the Asian Rugby Sevens Series in Incheon.

Asia Rugby's interim CEO, Benjamin van Rooyen, told an online press conference that the Hong Kong Rugby Union had provided the correct audio file to Asia Rugby when the Hong Kong rugby team played in Bangkok last month. 

He added the Korea Rugby Union should also have on file the national anthem since Hong Kong had played in the country in July. 

'What happened here is that Korea Rugby downloaded a version from the internet and had it in a folder, a zip folder, and that was the wrong one,' he told the press conference.

'Unfortunately, what I understand from Korea Rugby was that in the zip folder, there was a song – the song that was played – the wrong one, [it] was in the folder and it was never deleted,' he said, adding it was an intern who played it by mistake. 

'This was somebody who was provided with a song and somebody pressed play. That person has no understanding of the politics of the world.

'I don't think there were any ulterior motives in any of this. This was a simple human error.'

Van Rooyen said Hong Kong police had not been in touch, but he had learnt that officers had contacted the Hong Kong Rugby Union. 

He added staff members have been told not to search for anthems online from now on, and that Asia Rugby will in future sign agreements with local unions to say they would only play audio files provided by Asia Rugby. 

The Hong Kong Rugby Union in a statement said it accepted this was an unintentional error, but that 'it has caused significant harm to the team and people of Hong Kong'. 

'Future errors of this type shall necessitate the team's immediate withdrawal from competition,' the statement said.";Radio Television Hong Kong

President Chan Chak ming said he and three vice presidents had recently visited places including the UK, US and Singapore, and while it's not their role to tell a good Hong Kong story, they have shared details regarding the actual situation, and in an objective manner.

Chan said he dispelled misconceptions such as that all local judges are appointed by Beijing, and that there is no judicial independence, fair trials and free speech in Hong Kong.

I really can't see under the current environment, we are not allowed to criticise the government. We criticise the government all the time, he added.

If the government isn't doing their job, of course we can say it loudly. The hope is, we want the government to improve.

Chan says it's of paramount importance that Hong Kong maintains its common law system, noting that President Xi Jinping had mentioned this in July when he spoke about the necessity of Hong Kong keeping its unique advantages.

Given this necessity, the Law Society chief said, it's important for people like himself to maintain connections with practitioners in other common law jurisdictions.

Chan also said there's been a problem of legal practitioners moving overseas.

While the government had cited a manpower shortage, the Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) said it believes the real reason for the shrinking labour force is low wages and poor benefits.

Chan Tang yuen, Director of the FTU's Vocational Training and Employment Acceleration Committee, said the median wage of care workers in 2021 stood at HK$14,150, 30 percent lower than that of general employees in Hong Kong. 

Given the long hours, taxing duties and low pay that workers experience, Chan said it's inaccurate to simply diagnose the care sector as having a manpower shortage problem.

It's not that there are jobs and there are not enough people, Chan said. It's that the jobs are so bad that nobody wants to do it.

The FTU said the real way to attract more talent into the industry is by improving the remuneration and working conditions of local care workers. 

It called on the government to increase their monthly salary to at least HK$20,000 if it wants people to stay in the sector. 

It also urged authorities to consider replacing the current 12 hour, two shift system with an eight hour, three shift system to help with retention.

At present, under the 0+3 arrangement, inbound travellers do not have to undergo hotel quarantine but are given an amber health code, barring them from going to restaurants and certain places for three days.

In a Ming Pao opinion piece, Lo Man tuen, vice chairman of the All China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said the 0+3 arrangement has become de facto 0+0, after the government worked to scrap as many restrictions as possible while managing risks. 

But Lo said he believes if Hong Kong refers to its travel restrictions as 0+0, it would give the mainland the impression that the SAR is completely not guarded, which in turn makes it harder to propose measures on allowing Hongkongers to cross the border more easily. 

Speaking to reporters ahead of his weekly Executive Council meeting, the CE reiterated that Hong Kong's Covid policy is simple and clear.

There is much discussion about '0+0' and '0+3'. What does '0+0' mean? It means something different to different people. I will not specify what sort of arrangement if it is '0+0' or '0+3', he said. 

As long as we keep Covid risks manageable, we try to minimise the restrictions as much as possible. That position is clear. 

He also said Hong Kong has a duty to ensure it does not add to Covid risks on the mainland, as he acknowledged that infection numbers across the border are on the up. 

Lee added that discussions are underway on facilitating border crossing, including a plan on letting people quarantine in the SAR first before travelling to the mainland.

Meanwhile, the Jockey Club said people visiting racecourses will no longer be required to present their vaccine record QR codes from Sunday. The announcement follows the government's earlier announcement that some Covid curbs will be relaxed from Thursday.

The watchdog tested 25 fish oil samples and found that all of them had some type of contaminant. 

All but one were found to have the chemical 3 MCPD, with three exceeding European Union safety standards. Fourteen samples were also found to contain the genotoxic carcinogen glycidol.

In the experimental animal data, we found that it [3 MCPD] will affect our kidney, our central nervous system and also the male reproductive system. So this is something that should not be in our products, said Nora Tam, chairwoman of the council's research and testing committee. 

In one product from Adrien Gagnon, the level of both glycidol and 3 MCPD exceeded European Union safety standards. The council has referred the product to the Centre for Food Safety for follow up action.

Meanwhile, the council said it found discrepancies between content levels of omega 3 fatty acids and the declared values on nutrition labels. 

In two fish oil products for children and pregnant women, the amount of DHA   an omega 3 fatty acid   fell short of the labelled value by 70 percent. 

Tam reminded consumers that these nutrients can be absorbed through their regular diet. 

For omega 3 fatty acids, they are available in a lot of food, particularly fish. So you have to think twice: Do you really need to take this supplement? The best is eat the fresh food materials, so you don't need to rely all the time on supplements to get omega 3 fatty acids, she said.

He reiterated it's unacceptable that a song associated with violent protests in 2019, instead of the national anthem, was played.

Speaking to the media before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee did not elaborate on how the probe will be conducted or whether officers will travel to South Korea to collect evidence. 

He was asked what could be done to prevent similar incidents in future.

'It is the responsibility of the organisers. We'll do our best to assist the organisers to fulfil their obligations. But it is important that when mistakes are made, when problems arise, we point those problems out and there is a good investigation to know what actually happened, so that we will deal with the situation accordingly,' he said. 

Exco convenor Regina Ip told a radio programme that the Hong Kong police have the responsibility to look into the matter. 

She said she didn't believe it was a careless mistake, adding that officers should look into whether someone from Hong Kong had conspired with people there to conduct seditious or subversive acts.

'Hong Kong and South Korea have mutual legal assistance agreements. We have signed it long ago, it's our law. We have undertaken to help each other. Hong Kong police should act in accordance with this agreement and ask for South Korea's assistance,' she said. 

Ip noted that Hong Kong's national security law asserts jurisdiction outside the SAR, and if people from South Korea are believed to have engaged in criminal acts, Hong Kong can request Seoul to extradite its nationals to face trial here.

Photo: RTHK Chief Executive John Lee said on Monday that police will investigate whether there was a conspiracy to violate the national anthem law or other Hong Kong laws, after an incorrect song was played in its place at a rugby tournament in South Korea. 

The song, which is associated with violent protests in 2019, was played as the Hong Kong sevens team prepared to play hosts South Korea in Sunday's final of the second leg of the Asian Rugby Sevens Series in Incheon.

Event organiser Asia Rugby has apologised and blamed human error, but Lee said the case was unacceptable because the national anthem is a solemn matter, and officials must follow it up seriously.

Asked how the police can probe something that took place outside of Hong Kong, he said the force will act lawfully.

Hong Kong police will act in accordance with the law for any investigation. We will see what evidence we collect during the probe, and act accordingly, he told reporters after attending an event.

The CE said the Chief Secretary, Eric Chan, has met Korean Consular officials to strongly complain, and demanded an investigation into the matter.

In a statement, the police said its Organised Crime and Triad Bureau would look into the matter to investigate any breaches of the National Anthem Ordinance or any other legislation of Hong Kong, including the Hong Kong National Security Law.

Asia Rugby attributed the blunder to simple human error from a junior member of the local organising committee, playing a song downloaded from the internet instead of the correct anthem, adding that the national anthem was played afterwards.

It also said it took the match footage off air immediately and replaced it with the correct anthem on its social media platforms.

Photo: RTHK The government said on Monday that it has suspended the organisers of July's MIRROR concert, Music Nation, from hiring its venues while a criminal probe into how a giant video screen came to crash down on the stage during the show continues. 

The incident left two dancers injured, one of whom remains in hospital with serious spinal injuries. 

Last Friday, police alleged that the concert's main contractor had made false declarations about the weights of mechanical devices used in the show.

Four men and one woman who work for the main contractor and a stage engineering company involved in the show at the Hong Kong Coliseum were arrested.

Explaining a government report into the tragedy to lawmakers, Secretary for Culture Kevin Yeung said Music Nation cannot hire government venues for concerts before the end of the probe and relevant judicial proceedings. 

Each of the parties involved; how deeply they are involved in the incident; whether the relevant parties were deceived or were actually aware of the inaccurate information; we need to investigate further, Yeung told members of a Legco panel discussing the report.

But from the evidence we have, the terms and conditions of hire were violated. While pending further investigation, we suspend the permission of them to hire [government] venues.

Yeung said it's also possible that the firm could be banned for good, if there is evidence to show that it has other responsibilities.

The minister said despite the arrests of the five workers of two of the contractors for the concert – Engineering Impact and Hip Hing Loong Stage Engineering Company – the two firms' alleged involvement in the case is uncertain at this stage.

But for the sake of safety, he said if the hirers of government venues employ the two companies for installation work involving complicated stage designs, they may be required to pay for third party audits of safety checks.

Yeung said this is because the arrests have cast doubt on whether the firms can ensure their employees are able to safely undertake such work.";Radio Television Hong Kong

File photo: RTHK The High Court was wrong to permanently stay the drug trafficking trial of a man from Brazil, after the judge applied incorrect legal principles to exclude some text messages from the suspect's phone from the evidence. 

This is according to a written ruling by the Court of Final Appeal on Monday, which said the trial judge, Audrey Campbell Moffat, had erred in several legal principles during the proceedings last year. 

The case centered on a man who flew in from Sao Paulo via Zurich on September 10, 2019. Customs officers at Hong Kong airport found more than 3,300 grammes of cocaine in his suitcases.

The man denied knowing the drugs were hidden in the luggage, and claimed a woman he met online asked him to bring the cases to Hong Kong and told them they contained confidential documents.

Customs officers took photos of WhatsApp messages from the defendant's phone and submitted them as part of the facts admitted by both sides to the jury trial. 

But Justice Campbell Moffat questioned the admissibility of the photos and ordered a 'voire dire procedure' – a separate hearing held in the absence of the jury within the trial – to handle the matter. 

The messages and other references to them were eventually removed or redacted from the admitted facts after she ruled they were inadmissible.

The defendant later applied, and was granted, a permanent stay of the proceedings, on the grounds that he could not receive a fair trial without the WhatsApp evidence. He subsequently left Hong Kong while on bail. 

In its ruling on Monday, the top court said the trial judge should not have held the voire dire hearing, and thus was wrong to use its outcome as the basis to stay the prosecution. 

The Court of Final Appeal said the prosecution is now free to list the trial before another judge of the Court of First Instance, who may then issue a warrant of arrest against the suspect if he refuses to return to face trial.";Radio Television Hong Kong

Announcing the results of an investigation on Monday, the office said it took action against EC Healthcare after receiving complaints about four of its centres. 

The office said 28 of 39 brands under EC Healthcare, including Primecare and Dr Reborn, have adopted an integrated internal database involving the data of around a million members.

In one case, a complainant who visited a doctor in Primecare was told that her information had been transferred without notice to Dr Reborn, which the doctor had later joined. 

Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung called such acts disappointing, adding that the medical group failed to consult its clients before sharing their data. 

EC Healthcare failed to obtain the relevant consent from its customers before it put their personal data in the internal integrated system for use among the 28 brands. In this regard, I find their practice disappointing, she said. 

Chung added that her office will step up monitoring efforts on large healthcare organisations.

Meanwhile, photofinishing chain Fotomax has been issued an enforcement notice following a ransomware attack on the database of its online store.

The incident in October last year affected 544,862 members and 73,957 customers who had made purchases online. 

Chung said Fotomax had serious deficiencies when handling the matter, such as misevaluating security vulnerability risks and delaying implementation of multi factor authentication. 

Fotomax lacks the awareness of risks, and it also has serious deficiencies in its information system security, that lead to the hacking event, and that actually is the direct cause of the hacking event, she said.

The Hong Kong Sports Federation and Olympic Committee (SF&OC) on Monday said it is surprised to find out that the organiser of the Asian Rugby Seven Series had played the wrong song in place of the national anthem at a tournament in South Korea, adding that it finds the host's explanation unacceptable. 

The song, which is associated with violent protests in 2019, was played as the Hong Kong sevens team prepared to play South Korea in Sunday's final of the second leg of the Asian Rugby Sevens Series in Incheon.

The event organiser, Asia Rugby, had apologised to the Hong Kong Rugby Union (HKRU), saying it was a result of human error by a junior staff member. 

The SF&OC said it finds the explanation unacceptable. 

'SF&OC is surprised by the mistake made by the organiser of Asian Rugby Seven Series. The initial explanation provided by the organiser is unacceptable. SF&OC has instructed HKRU to conduct in depth investigation and follow up to prevent similar incidents from happening again,' the committee wrote in a statement. 

'The national anthem is a symbol of the country, the playing and singing of the national anthem is a solemn ceremony. Athletes representing Hong Kong, China in international games and competitions shall fully reflect this spirit to preserve the dignity of the national anthem.'

The Hong Kong government has also expressed its displeasure over what happened and demanded that the HKRU launch a detailed investigation.

In a statement, Asia Rugby said it deeply regrets the incident.

The statement says Asia Rugby and Korea Rugby Union would like to sincerely apologise to the Chinese and Hong Kong governments as well as the HKRU.

The incident happened due to a simple human error from a junior member of the local organising committee, playing a song downloaded from the internet instead of the correct anthem, Asia Rugby said, adding that the national anthem was played afterwards.

Asia Rugby said it took the match footage off the air immediately and replaced it with the correct anthem on its social media platforms.

Several doors were ripped off the train as it pulled into the station, leading to services being suspended along much of the Tsuen Wan Line for the rest of the day.

The railway company's operations director, Tony Lee, told an RTHK programme that staff members have since inspected more than 30 locations with similar devices and have made sure they are safe. 

He said their investigation will continue.

'We will look at it [the component] from different directions. For example, its maintenance, as well as its condition and whether there is any wear and tear. We will also look at the design. We will spend more time to carry out a thorough probe,' he said. 

The MTR's chief of operating, Sammy Wong, told the same programme that the corporation will also look into why around 150 passengers left the train via an emergency exit and walked all the way to Mong Kok Station through the tunnel.

He neither confirmed nor denied reports that the driver had instructed some passengers to do this, while the majority of those on board left via Yau Ma Tei Station.

The respiratory medicine professor from Chinese University pointed out that the epidemic situation has been stable of late, with the daily caseload ranging from 4,000 to 5,000. 

The instantaneous effective reproductive number of the virus has been lower than one. In other words, the chances of another surge [in cases] are very slim, Hui said.

Plus the vaccination rate has been gradually going up, so I believe the epidemic will continue to ease.

He said there is room to reduce the number of compulsory PCR tests for arrivals. 

Currently, travellers have to do four PCR tests after arriving in Hong Kong, on top of several days of rapid tests.

But one measure that cannot be relaxed just yet, Hui said, is the face mask mandate.

He said the authorities should only consider relaxing mask requirements after winter, warning there may be serious outbreaks of respiratory diseases because the viruses involved haven't been circulating for more than two years.

She added that authorities would keep in touch with the MTR and would make announcements as soon as possible regarding arrangements for Monday morning's peak hours.

Kam also rejected criticism of the decision to send some of the passengers involved in the incident into the tunnel, rather than letting them get off the train via the platform.

Some 750 passengers were on board a Tsuen Wan Line train when two sets of doors were ripped off a carriage at Yau Ma Tei Station. 

While the vast majority of the passengers managed to leave the train via the station, about 150 exited through an emergency door at the back of the train and then walked along the tunnel to the next station. 

A man surnamed Kwok told RTHK that it was the train driver who told passengers to leave this way.

The train captain kept telling passengers to calm down and said there was smoke. We didn't know what happened. After a while, he told us to disembark from the rear of the train and walk back to Mong Kok along the track, Kwok said.

After we opened the doors, we didn't know whether we should wait for staff members to come show us the way, or whether we should start walking. We were very confused. The public announcement was unclear. We waited but no one showed up so we left the train. We didn't know what they wanted us to do.

Kwok added that the tunnel was very dark and passengers used the torches on their mobile phones to see where they were going. 

One woman, 78, suffered abrasions while in the tunnel and was taken to hospital, and another felt unwell. 

However, Zhang told RTHK that there was no need for any of the passengers to go into the tunnel.

This is not favourable at all, because we know the tunnel environment is not really for people to stay. There are a lot of hazards and unexpected risks. Only in very, very extreme situations, like fire or heavy smoke, is this the last resort as the way out, he said. 

In today's case, it is very clear that there was no imminent risk in staying in the train. A more favourable option was to evacuate the passengers using the platform.

On Friday, the government downgraded its GDP growth forecast for the year, predicting the local economy to shrink by 3.2 percent. Its previous estimate ranged from a contraction of 0.5 percent to a 0.5 percent expansion.

On a radio programme on Sunday, Chan also noted that a fiscal deficit of more than HK$100 billion is expected this year.

There are a few reasons, including poor market conditions, shrinking corporate profits tax, relatively quiet stock and property markets, and less revenue from stamp duties. So a fiscal deficit is inevitable, he said. 

However, Chan said there is no need to be too pessimistic about the economy, adding that the government will consider spending some of its HK$800 billion of fiscal reserves on counter cyclical measures if the economy continues to weaken.

Passengers said two sets of doors of a Tsuen Wan Line train bound for Central were damaged.

Images from the scene showed several doors that appeared to have either come off entirely or were hanging off.

Police said they received reports at around 9.30am of smoke coming from the doors of the train as it pulled into Yau Ma Tei Station.

A 78 year old woman suffered abrasions as some 750 passengers were evacuated. She was taken to hospital, police said.

Firefighters said about 600 of those evacuated left via Yau Ma Tei Station, but around 150 passengers had to walk through the tunnel to Mong Kok Station.

Firefighters and MTR engineers were dispatched to Yau Ma Tei Station.

Services between Lai King and Jordan were suspended, with replacement buses laid on. 

The MTR said trains were running at eight minute intervals between Lai King and Tsuen Wan, and six minute intervals between Jordan and Central.

File photo: RTHK All five suspects arrested in connection with an incident that injured two dancers during a show by the popular boy band MIRROR were granted bail on Saturday. 

The four men and one woman taken into custody on Friday are workers for the main contractor and a stage engineering company involved in the show at the Hong Kong Coliseum in Hung Hom in July, when a giant screen plunged onto the stage. 

Four of them are suspected of fraud and allowing objects to fall from height, while the other was arrested on suspicion only of the latter offence. 

All were released on bail a day after their arrest, and will have to report back to the police next month. No charges have been laid.

Police earlier said they suspected the main contractor deliberately under reported the weights of mechanical devices used at the gig, adding that there was evidence the subcontractor failed to follow up on operational issues identified during rehearsals. 

Meanwhile a government probe concluded that the organisers of the concert had violated leasing terms for hiring the Coliseum. It's alleged that they provided inaccurate information.

The father of injured dancer Mo Li said the findings of the government inquiry have done justice to his son, other dancers and all those who are affected. 

In a prayer request, Reverend Derek Li also noted the organisers of the concert, MakerVille and Music Nation, had pledged to continue bearing the cost of medical expenses for the injured performers. 

He added that his son, who remains hospitalised with a spinal injury, has been making progress, which he described as a sigh of relief.

Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Lam – who is also a legislator – said it would now be more convenient for travellers to go to the mainland from Hong Kong, and for tourists to come to the SAR from across the border.

Mainland authorities announced on Friday that inbound travellers would need to spend only five days – instead of seven – in centralised quarantine. They will still have to isolate at home for a further three days.

There are costs every day [when you are quarantined]. You have to pay for the hotel room, and you can't work. So even though '5+3' is not what some people expected, I think it is a good start, he told reporters after the programme.

The Business and Professional Alliance lawmaker said he hoped the number of Hong Kong people allowed to travel to the mainland each day would be increased, and that some business travellers would be allowed to cross the border quarantine free.

On local anti Covid measures, Lam said medical surveillance rules for incoming travellers should be eased so people can dine in restaurants during their first three days here, when they have an amber code.

He said authorities should also reduce the number of PCR tests new arrivals must take, replacing them with rapid antigen tests, but he agreed that it was appropriate to loosen Covid curbs gradually.

The Liberal Party leader, Tommy Cheung, who represents the catering sector in the Legislative Council, spoke on the same programme and echoed Lam's views.

From the economic perspective, the catering sector surely wants all measures to be eased, so there will be no social distancing and masks aren't needed. Many people would want that. But we have to understand... we can't let our public hospitals collapse, he said.

But Cheung's party mate, Peter Shiu, said he hoped the government would relax Covid restrictions more quickly to help the economy.

The fall of the giant LED screen at the concert on July 28 injured two dancers, including Mo Li, who remains in hospital due to a spinal injury.

Announcing the highlights of the months long probe on Friday, culture minister Kevin Yeung said it's clear that the venue hirer had violated terms by allegedly providing inaccurate information about the weight of the fallen screen, as well as failing to ensure its safety and stability.

He stressed the government will take matters seriously and prosecute offenders in accordance with the law. 

Authorities made several recommendations, including requiring event organisers to hire qualified professionals to verify the weight of the installations, as well as ensuring mobile devices pass loading tests.

They also proposed bringing in third party auditors to conduct additional inspections.

We will study the feasibility of having an independent audit on a selective basis. We're creating an extra checking to ensure all the works are fully complied with, Yeung said, adding that officials will further discuss this with the trade before implementation.

Meanwhile, labour minister Chris Sun said the dancers injured in the case are employees of an unnamed dancing company.

He alleged that the firm has failed to insure staff and report the injuries in a timely manner, adding that the Labour Department will decide whether to press ahead with prosecution after consulting the Department of Justice.

Organisers of the MIRROR concert, MakerVille and Music Nation, said they will continue to cooperate with the police and the government, and seek legal advice on the matter. 

They added that they fully support the government's recommendations on ways to improve industry standards.

In a statement, the Social Welfare Department said it decided to relax the rules as most care home residents and workers have been vaccinated against Covid.

The department said dedicated transport should be arranged to take residents and staff to and from designated locations. They also have to follow pre arranged itineraries.

Crowded areas and mask off activities, such as eating and drinking, should be avoided, it added.

Officers also said they arrested five people in connection with the incident during the show at the Hong Kong Coliseum on July 28 during which two dancers were injured when a giant video screen fell onto the stage.

One of them, Mo Li, who was seriously hurt, remains in hospital following treatment for his spinal injury.

Officers said four men and one woman aged between 40 and 63 were taken into custody. 

The suspects include four senior staff members of the main contractor Engineering Impact who have been accused of fraud and allowing objects to fall from height. 

Another suspect, from subcontractor Hip Hing Loong Stage Engineering Company, was arrested on suspicion of allowing objects to fall from height.

Speaking in a press briefing, superintendent Alan Chung of the Kowloon West regional crime unit said some of the mechanical devices used at the concert, such as LED monitors and speakers, were found to be heavier than what had been reported by the main contractor.

Police said, for example, that the weight of the speakers was seven times heavier than what had been declared.

They made the false declarations deliberately with the view to speed up the approval process for the show, Chung said. 

Officers also said there was evidence that the subcontractor had failed to follow up on operational issues during rehearsals on the day of the incident.

This [plan] is not limited to specialists, it can also include dentists, nurses and others, but we will discuss with different professionals on what they need, Lo told a Legco meeting on Friday.

Speaking at an event marking the end of the Hong Kong Legal Week, Cheung said the concept of the rule of law could be misinterpreted and taken for granted, and that legal education is needed for young people.

Without fair mindedness and a culture of lawfulness, there can be no rule of law. These are values that we must now work hard to impart on the next generations, to ensure that they too will safeguard the rule of law and enjoy the benefits of a fair and peaceful society in which justice is accessible to all.

Cheung also said the rule of law has to keep up with the times. He cited more people turning to dispute resolution rather than litigation in recent years as an example.

The importance of the rule of law continuing to develop is critical in ensuring that the developing needs of society are met, particularly as relates to access to justice by society at large, he said.

Failing to meet this demand could lead to disillusionment with the rule of law, and it is of critical importance to the future that the support of the next generation for the rule of law is enlisted.

Cheung said the judicial system here has not only provided a secure business environment in which disputes can be resolved in a fair manner, but has also consistently given generous interpretations regarding human rights and jealously guarded against restrictions.

Both Chief Executive John Lee and Secretary for Justice Paul Lam, who spoke at the same event, also stressed the need to promote the rule of law in Hong Kong.

Researchers from the Baptist Oi Kwan Social Service and the City University of Hong Kong (CityU) surveyed 200 employers and human resources professionals between February and September. 

The study found that half of the respondents had hired disabled workers, mainly through NGOs.

However, about one third of employers said they were unable to find candidates who match their needs, while more than half said they found it hard to create an inclusive workplace environment.

Many enterprises lack knowledge in supporting people with disabilities. They may not have the relevant knowledge. They don't know how to accommodate people with various disabilities, he said. 

I think NGOs should be able to play an important role to fill the gap, to support enterprises in recruiting and offer more resources so they can know how to accommodate people with disabilities. 

He also called on the government to enhance education on disability inclusion to prevent discrimination in the workplace. 

Meanwhile, the service head at the Baptist Oi Kwan Social Service, Carol Lee, said the government should subsidise NGOs to provide vocational training for disabled staff.

At present, incoming travellers no longer have to undergo hotel quarantine, but are given an amber code that bars them from going to restaurants or other regulated places for three days and requires them to test regularly for Covid 19, under the so called '0+3' arrangement. 

But Shi urged the government to scrap the amber code as well to achieve a '0+0' status. 

If we still don't implement the '0+0' arrangement, it'd inevitably give people the impression that Hong Kong is not a hundred percent back yet, he said on an RTHK programme. 

When we do business, we don't just attend meetings, as many people haven't met face to face for a long time, everyone would like to go out for a meal, but they can't do that now, said Shi. 

He suggested that as a first step, amber code holders might be allowed to eat at specific areas in major exhibition venues.

We should at least catch up with the opening up of the rest of the world in order to tell a good Hong Kong story for real, and to welcome international tourists and business travellers. This is something we urgently need to do.'

However, Health Secretary Lo Chung mau stressed that the Covid situation in Hong Kong is still a public health emergency.

On his blog, he noted there have been suggestions that the SAR has fully returned to normalcy and the pandemic no longer amounts to a public health emergency, after large scale international conferences and the Hong Kong Sevens were held this month.

Lo said whether or not the city has a public health emergency is decided upon based on local data and the global situation, but not one or two events or opinions from a couple of people. 

The Omicron strain is not Ebola, nor Sars. It is also not the coronavirus strain in early 2020, nor the flu either. Recently, the few thousand daily new cases still pose a threat to the lives and health of high risk groups...which could also affect the operation of the public healthcare system, he wrote. 

Coupled with the threat of new variants, we believe that the Covid 19 outbreak is still a public health emergency for Hong Kong at this stage.

He added that the authorities will gradually resume more social and economic activities as the Covid situation stabilises, while protecting the health and safety of the city's residents.";Radio Television Hong Kong

Image: Shutterstock The founder of a group that promotes hiking, conservation and wildlife in Hong Kong on Thursday called it absurd that camp sites in Hong Kong are still closed under anti pandemic rules.

Martin Williams, from Hong Kong Outdoors, made the comment after DAB lawmaker Ben Chan called on Wednesday for the re opening of camp sites after public barbecue pits were recently re opened, as the government slowly eases Covid measures. 

Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today, Williams criticised what he called a 'mish mash' of pandemic policies, adding that it was 'absurd' for the government to allow up to 240 people to attend a banquet, while not allowing access to outdoor campsites.

'There's never been any scientific soundness, or commonsense to this,' he said.

Williams added that the closure of outdoor camp sites and barbecue pits were 'an overreaction', and showed a 'great misunderstanding about Covid'.

'The sad thing then is the misunderstanding about Covid and the actual dangers with it, and the places like ventilation that we should have been focusing on, he said.

It's become a bit of a wrong target to aim at. Instead in all this time we should have improved ventilation indoors, we should have got air filtration, and we should have people fully knowledgeable that if you breathe fresh outdoor air, you're not going to get Covid, or it's extremely unlikely unless you're in a dense crowd, and people don't know.'";Radio Television Hong Kong

Photo: RTHK A green group on Wednesday called on government departments to set their own carbon emission targets and lay out a more comprehensive roadmap to carbon neutrality.

In its latest study, Greenpeace spoke to 74 departments in September about their carbon emission efforts, and examined Environmental Performance Reports released in 2021 by 44 of them.

While the government's target is for Hong Kong to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050, the study found that none of its departments had set quantifiable emission targets or a timetable for carbon neutrality.

'Actually there are so many measures they can do. I would say that after how many years of promoting carbon neutrality, they know how to do it, said Greenpeace campaigner Tom Ng.

'They know what kind of measures are needed, but they also need to show the public what are their goals, and when are they going to achieve those goals.'

Ng also called some carbon reduction policies covered in the government reports 'out of date', saying some of them have been in place for almost a decade.

He said that for example in one of the latest reports, using lead free petrol was mentioned as an environmental initiative, despite leaded petrol being banned since 1999. 

Ng urged the government to roll out up to date environmental policies to realise its carbon neutral goal by 2050.

File photo: AFP An appellate court on Wednesday upheld a decision to allow a veteran British lawyer to defend media tycoon Jimmy Lai in his upcoming national security trial. 

Lai, 74, had earlier been granted permission by High Court Judge Jeremy Poon to engage King's Counsel, Timothy Owen, in the trial that is scheduled to begin on December 1. 

The Secretary for Justice subsequently appealed against the admission of Owen, arguing that his involvement will not add any significant dimension to the trial. 

The government had argued that Owen did not have the expertise or experience in issues concerning the offences that Lai was charged with under the national security law – which it said was tailored to Hong Kong's unique constitutional framework. 

As for another charge of printing and distributing seditious publications brought against Lai under the Crimes Ordinance, the government said there is already 'substantial experience' among local barristers to handle it. 

But a three judge panel rejected the government's grounds. 

In a written judgment, the panel said the decision to admit Owen had balanced different aspects, including the novelty and the great general public importance of the legal issues involved, the unusual difficulty and complexity of the case, and its substantial impact on the development of Hong Kong law. 

The appellant court said 'the unique context of the national security law' should not take precedence over other aspects of public interest when it comes to the admission of overseas counsels. 

The judges added that the public's perception of fairness in the trial is of vital importance to the administration of justice, adding that Owen should be admitted on grounds of public perception as well. 

Lai, the founder of the now defunct Apple Daily newspaper, will face trial for allegedly taking part in a conspiracy to print, publish, sell, offer for sale, distribute, display and/or reproduce seditious publications, as well as conspiring with others to collude with a foreign country or external elements to endanger national security.";Radio Television Hong Kong

The Buildings Department said more than 1,700 abandoned signs will be removed or repaired in a year, with at least 1,800 signs cleared next year. Supervised by Cheuk and the director of buildings, Clarice Yu Po mei, the removal works were carried out at 8.30am to avoid disruption of traffic or inconvenience toshops nearby and pedestrians. Acting on complaints from the public, the Buildings Department issued dangerous structure removal orders to the owners of the four abandoned signboards that were attached to external walls. They were required to remove the signboards within 60 days. But the signboards had not been removed despite the removal notices expiring, so the department arranged removal work yesterday. The department has also stepped up enforcement action against dangerous and abandoned signboards in recent years by conducting surveys in districts with high pedestrian and vehicle flows. The department completed a survey in Sham Shui Po last month with about 300 removal orders issued and more than 700 dangerous or abandoned signboards removed or repaired. The survey in Tsuen Wan is ongoing and the department estimated that about 140 notices will be issued, involving200 dangerous or abandoned signboards. The Building Department said if a signboard is abandoned or has become dangerous, irrespective of whether it is legal or not, removal order under the public health and municipal services ordinance will be issued to the owner. If the notice is not complied with, the Buildings Department will arrange for removing the signboard and recover the costs from the signboard owner, it said yesterday. eunice.lam@singtaonewscorp.com Today's Standard Trademark and Copyright Notice: Copyright 2022, The Standard Newspaper Publishing Ltd., and its related entities.

It will open at 8am on December 11, transport authorities announced. The new tunnel will shorten the commute between Tseung Kwan O Town Centre and the Eastern Harbour crossing   about seven kilometers via the Tseung Kwan O Tunnel   to just 4.2km. The new 3.8km tunnel will in the west connect to Cha Kwo Ling Road and the Eastern Harbour Crossing, as well as the T2 trunk road and Cha Kwo Ling Tunnel in Kwun Tong, both of which are now under construction. In the east, the tunnel will connect to Po Shun Road and the Cross Bay Link. It will divert an estimated 30 to 40 percent of traffic from the Tseung Kwan O Tunnel, said Michael Leung Chung lap, project manager of the Civil Engineering and Development Department's east development office. That estimate means some 36,000 vehicles at most. But it is subject to change, said the assistant commissioner for transport, Ricky Ho Wai kee. Visual displays indicating drivers' estimated time of arrival will be installed on overhead road signs. Two interchanges will be at the ends of the tunnel. The Lam Tin interchange is next to the Eastern Harbor Crossing Toll Plaza, while the Tseung Kwan O interchange will be at Junk Bay, at the western end of the Cross Bay Link. The toll fee at Tseung Kwan O Tunnel will be waived from midnight on December 11, eight hours before the Tseung Kwan O Lam Tin Tunnel opens to the public. When commissioned alongside the Tseung Kwan O Lam Tin Tunnel, the Cross Bay Link will shorten the journey between Lohas park and Kwun Tong Town Centre by up to 20 minutes during morning peak hours. The 1.8km link, a dual two lane carriageway with a bike lane and a footway, is the first of its kind in Hong Kong. Motor vehicles running on the link will be subject to a speed limit of 80km an hour The link will connect with the bike lanes and footpaths surrounding Junk Bay to form a scenic five km track along the coastline. New routes run by Kowloon Motor Bus and New World First Bus will begin operation on December 12.

The Union said they had asked each team to submit national anthems to play during the matches but failed to get one from the Hong Kong team. In response to the Korea Rugby Union, the Hong Kong Rugby Union (HKRU) issued a statement on Tuesday to clarify that the Asia Rugby competition management team on October 23 have 'confirmed directly with the Hong Kong team management that The March of the Volunteers was the correct anthem to be played' during the ensuing competition. HKRU added that the national anthem was played at the series event in Thailand at the end of October and was expected to be played at every cup final that defending champions Hong Kong may reach in the series. 'At no point were HKRU or Series organizers Asia Rugby informed that Korea Rugby Union intended to play anthems it had sourced on its own via the internet, or any other unauthorized versions of the national anthem other than that as confirmed by the HKRU to Asia Rugby,' the statement said. 'Future errors of this type shall necessitate the team's immediate withdrawal from competition.' The Korea Rugby Union apologized for playing Glory to Hong Kong instead of the Chinese national anthem during the game held in Incheon on Sunday. A public relations representative from the Korean organization told The Korea Times that We ask each country to submit national anthems to play, but failed to get one (from the Hong Kong team). He added that our staff saved 'the Hong Kong national anthem' listed on the top of a search engine in the file folder named, 'Hong Kong.' The person continued that Asia Rugby later informed the Korea Rugby Union that the organization should play China's national anthem for the Hong Kong team but failed to delete the mistakenly saved file and delivered it to the broadcasting team. The official added that a staff member of the broadcasting team played the song in the file when Hong Kong made it to the final. Also, the person said that the organizer then played the Chinese national anthem for the Hong Kong team during the award ceremony after Hong Kong won the final. The remarks of the Korea Rugby Union contradict those of the Hong Kong government. The SAR government said the Hong Kong team had submitted the anthem file to the local operator, and chastised Asia Rugby about what happened and asked for an in depth investigation. In a Monday press release titled, HKSAR Government strongly deplores and opposes playing of the wrong national anthem at the Asian Rugby Seven Series, the release said, Rugby Asia also confirmed that the recording of the National Anthem submitted by the coach of the Hong Kong Team was the correct one.

The Civil Engineering and Development Department announced that the construction is now in the final stage. Projects of the inside part of the Tunnel and the Cross Bay Link are almost completed, said a spokesperson of the Department. The Tunnel is a new trunk road linking Tseung Kwan O and the urban area, with a total length of about 3.8 kilometres, of which about 2.2km is in the form of a tunnel. It connects the Cross Bay Link and Po Shun Road in the east; and the Eastern Harbour Crossing, Cha Kwo Ling Road in Kwun Tong and the Trunk Road T2 under construction in the west. The Cross Bay Link is approximately 1.8km in length, of which about one kilometre is a marine viaduct. It links the Tunnel and Wan Po Road adjacent to LOHAS Park. In addition to diverting the traffic at Wan Po Road, the marine viaduct will connect to the cycle track along the Tseung Kwan O waterfront to form a five kilometres coastal cycling track loop. The Tunnel and the Cross Bay Link will provide a new route between Tseung Kwan O and Kwun Tong as well as the Eastern Harbour Crossing, according to the Transport and Logistics Bureau, shortening the journey time between the LOHAS Park and Kwun Tong Town Centre by up to about 20 minutes during the morning peak hours. Around 40 percent of the traffic which previously travelled through the Tseung Kwan O Tunnel will divert to the new tunnel, alleviating the congestion problem of the Tseung Kwan O Tunnel, said the Bureau. The government also announced to waive the toll for the Tunnel from the day when it and the Cross Bay Link are open to traffic. Citybus and New World First Bus plan to launch two new routes in parallel with the commissioning of the new TKO LTT and Cross Bay Link, to provide direct and fast journey to Tsim Sha Tsui and Mong Kok.

Six of the ten defendants from the Construction Site Workers General Union were on trial on Tuesday morning at Eastern Magistrates' Courts. The ten held a gathering on May 6, 2020, in the street next to MTR Admiralty Station to give away anti epidemic supplies with flyers and notes saying protesting slogans attached. Some also used loudspeakers to advocate political demands on a footbridge. Police came to the scene around 12pm and required the volunteers to dismiss. However, the ten volunteers refused to leave and were arrested two hours later under the offense of the restrictions on gatherings in public. Four of the defendants have pleaded guilty to the count and were fined HK$4,500 respectively in May this year, as well as two of the remaining six were ruled with a HK$4,000 fine each by the Magistrate today. It is the duty of every citizen to fight against the epidemic, especially during the severe situation, said Magistrate Vivian Ho Wai han in the court. [But] the defendants ignored the warnings of police in the gathering deliberately, she said, which is extremely selfish and irresponsible. The rest four of the six will face imprisonment pending the second round of trial next February as being accused of other counts of taking part in a political demonstration in Admiralty on May 1, 2020.

The incident was first reported to police around 8pm that the man surnamed Yuen drove his van down a slope on Shek O Road. It was understood that Yuen had an argument with his wife on Sunday and left behind a suicide note before he was gone for good. The wife then contacted friends to help search for Yuen and reported to police but still failed to reach Yuen. Around 8pm Monday, a friend of Yuen spotted his van crashed at a slope by Shek O Road near Tung Ah Tsuen and reported to police and firefighters. However, rescuers didn't locate Yuen as they arrived at the scene. As the manhunt continued Tuesday, they finally found Yuen at the bushes by a slope down Hong Kong Trail Section 7, near To Tei Wan Tsuen around 11am. Yuen sustained injuries to his hands, feet, and waist, and was sent to Eastern Hospital in Chai Wan. If you or someone you know are having suicidal thoughts, help is available.

Speaking on a radio program this morning, the health expert said the SAR government should take bold steps to drastically relax the city's social distancing measures in view of the current Covid situation. He said 'pro forma' and unpractical measures such as the scanning of LeaveHomeSafe QR codes before entering designated venues should be canceled. He also suggested triple jabbed individuals to be exempted from compulsory nucleic acid tests, and isolation requirements for Covid close contacts to be removed when they tested negative through RATs. As for inbound control measures, Ho said authorities should scrap the amber health code arrangement and the nucleic acid test requirements for incoming travelers. At present, incoming travelers no longer have to undergo hotel quarantine, but are given an amber code that bars them from going to restaurants or other regulated places for three days and requires them to test regularly for Covid 19, under the '0+3' arrangement. Meanwhile, the microbiologist said studies in Brazil showed that taking the BioNTech Covid vaccine as a third dose after two Sinovac doses is more effective in preventing the infection and serious diseases than taking Sinovac as the third dose. He said citizens could consider taking the BioNTech vaccine as their third dose if they have opted for the Sinovac vaccine for their first two jabs, while also taking into account their personal health conditions.

The incident took place around 4am today when the young woman surnamed Lau was walking along Jordan Road in Yau Ma Tei with two friends. Lau's ex boyfriend and three others jumped out of a black Benz that reached the scene and forcefully took Lau on board. They then drove Lau to a unit at Well Fung Industrial Center on Ta Chuen Ping Street in Kwai Chung, where they violently assaulted her, caused bruises to her eyes and face, and left injuries all over her body. Lau was later released by the four and her two friends rushed to Kwai Chung to pick her up. They then retreated to a motel on Shanghai Street in Yau Ma Tei and reported to police. Officers located Lau in the Yau Ma Tei motel after receiving the report and initiated investigations. Lau was sent to Kwong Wah Hospital and the case was listed an illegal detention and assault causing actual bodily harm. The case is now handled by Yau Tsim district crime investigation team and no one has been arrested so far. It was understood that Lau's ex was a member of triad society Wo Shing Wo. They developed a romantic relationship in June last year that ended in bad terms recently.

The removal work came as part of a citywide cleanup program led by Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration Cheuk Wing hing, which aims to boost cleansing efforts at about 600 hygiene and street management black spots in the city. The department said in a statement today that apart from acting on public reports, it has stepped up its enforcement action against dangerous and abandoned signboards in recent years by conducting Planned Sign Surveys in districts with high pedestrian and vehicular flows. Signboards in selected districts will be removed to ensure public safety, it said. The department said it completed a survey in Sham Shui Po in late October and issued about 300 Dangerous Structure Removal Notices, along with having over 700 dangerous or abandoned signboards removed or repaired. 'The Planned Sign Survey in Tsuen Wan is ongoing and it is anticipated that about 140 Dangerous Structure Removal Notices will be issued, involving some 200 dangerous or abandoned signboards,' the department wrote. The department added that if the notices were not complied with, authorities will arrange for removing the signboard and recover the costs from the signboard owner.

Property buyers queued in front of the Housing Authority Customer Service Centre in Lok Fu at around 9am, waiting for the selection process to start this morning.

According to the Housing Authority last week, the latest batch of Home Ownership Scheme flats is priced at between HK$1.23 million and HK$5.3 million, enjoying around a 49 percent discount on the market price.

Please refresh the page and/or try again. In March, 2021, Beijing passed legislation to ensure 'patriots' govern Hong Kong. The move reduced democratic representation in the legislature, tightened control of elections and introduced a pro Beijing vetting panel to select candidates. The Hong Kong government said the overhaul would ensure the city's stability and prosperity. But the changes also prompted international condemnation, as it makes it near impossible for pro democracy candidates to stand. There is putting a brave face on bad news, there is spin, and there are outright falsities. All three were on offer after the latest Legco elections, spurned by more than 70 percent of the registered voters.

https://hongkongfp.com/hong-kong-free-press-annual-report-2021/;; Hong Kong Free Press Annual Report 2021; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit Our latest Annual Report includes a Transparency Report based on our latest yearly, independent audit. Letter from the Editor Dear readers and supporters, Over the past year, the HKFP newsroom underwent a transformation – we expanded, professionalised, moving to a new, larger, private office. We doubled our freelance budget, hired three new staff, won a SOPA award, and produced almost 150 fully fledged original features. Our team covered the first 'patriots only' election, Covid 19, the national security law, and we exceeded our Funding Drive target, bringing 1,000 monthly Patrons online. But 2021 was also a brutal year for the media industry in Hong Kong, with newsrooms raided, editors arrested and outlets disbanding in fear. In all, over 60 civil society groups disappeared last year, all whilst the authorities said press freedom was intact, deeming foreign criticism of journalist arrests a violation of international law. Yet we are continuing our work. HKFP was founded seven years ago as a response to press freedom concerns, but – aside from our 2020 work visa denial – our newsroom has never been directly troubled by the authorities. This is likely owing to our impartial stance, transparent funding, and balanced coverage guided by an Ethics Code and Corrections Policy. Press freedom is guaranteed by the Basic Law, Bill of Rights and security law – it is in our name, and it is on this basis that we operate. For these reasons, HKFP staff are united in our commitment to continue our on the ground award winning reporting. Nonetheless, we cannot be naïve when it comes to ensuring staff safety and security, protecting sources, and trying our best to navigate unclear legal realities whilst test cases go through court. We are a Hong Kong news outlet, we love this city, and we have not entertained the idea of reporting on it from elsewhere. Besides, it is only by being on the ground that we can maintain nuance and accuracy through attending events, press conferences, court cases and speaking directly with Hongkongers. But because of the current uncertainties facing journalists, we may make some precautionary changes this year upon legal advice. Above all though, we will always be guided by the journalistic tradition, our ethics code, and the day to day mission of ensuring accuracy and fairness. And despite recent events, we do not believe there are any Hong Kong stories we would have to avoid reporting. I am happy to present our Annual Report, as we round up our best coverage, achievements, and our accounts from the past 12 months. During this coming year, we look forward to covering the city's leadership race, the 25 th anniversary of the Handover, the pandemic and court cases. And with your support and readership, the HKFP team will continue to hold the line and press on! Our Mission & Impact Founded in 2015, Hong Kong Free Press is an impartial, non profit, award winning English language newspaper. Run by journalists, backed by readers and completely independent, HKFP is governed by a public code of ethics. Best of 2021 Original features: Our features in 2021 documented Hong Kong's transformation under the shadow of the Beijing enacted security law. We delved into how counsellors and psychologists grappled with the fear of creeping self censorship in their practice, how booksellers were reported to the national security police during the Hong Kong Book Fair for selling politically sensitive titles, and how one of the city's last remaining independent bookstores shuttered, citing the political environment. We also looked at how the city's filmmakers, publishers and street artists navigated the shifting red lines, and how some Hongkongers are inking messages of resistance onto their own skin. The city's media landscape forever changed last year with the closure of pro democracy newspaper Apple Daily. HKFP was at its newsrooms and printing presses on its last day of operations. We also explored how the city's Beijing backed press are gaining more influence. The year also saw the mass resignations of pro democracy district councillors after new oath requirements were introduced. We documented the final days of one local councillor in office and explored how the exodus of district representatives also left community newspapers struggling. As protest related and national security cases piled up in the city's courts, we spoke with lawyers compiling a protest case database to preserve the city's rule of law, the activists writing letters to detained protesters, and the international lawyers who launched an advice website to inform Hongkongers of their legal rights. We also spoke with a refugee from Vietnam who was stuck behind bars for almost three decades after being convicted of murder as a teenager, and eventually decided to abandon his fight against deportation. Amid the changes of 2021, a wave of Hongkongers left for the UK. HKFP was at the airport when long queues formed as people bid farewell to loved ones. In the UK, we reported on the people helping newly arrived Hongkongers settle in, as well the pro China groups pressuring them. Hong Kong also saw the implementation of a sweeping overhaul of the city's electoral system. HKFP gave extensive coverage on the day of the city's first 'patriots only' legislative election – candidates made urgent appeal to voters while Hong Kong saw the lowest turnout rate ever. Following a 48 hour purge of Tiananmen Massacre monuments from university campuses over Christmas, we also spoke with students, academics, as well as artists behind the statues about what the removals meant for Hong Kong's efforts to commemorate those who died in the military crackdown of student led demonstrations over 32 years ago. Our team visited local businesses at risk of forced closure after government led redevelopments in Fo Tan and Kwun Tong. Elsewhere, we spoke with the owners of Hong Kong's remaining iconic Dai Pai Dongs facing eviction from their community, and the elderly villager fighting to save his home from developers in the New Territories. We also reported on the opening of the newly revamped historic Central Market and the long awaited M+ museum. Covid 19 restrictions continued to disrupt Hongkongers' daily lives last year. We examined government statistics to question whether the city's severe quarantine measures were really necessary, how even vaccinated people were forced into quarantine centres, how foreign domestic workers faced more challenging working conditions during the pandemic, and the rise in discrimination against South East Asians. We also delved into the trend of 'vaccine selfies,' how pandemic related pressure on airlines led some pilots to accuse companies of age discrimination, and the plight of those left stranded in the UK during Hong Kong's months long flight suspensions. Our pandemic coverage also tackled how the coronavirus made life even more difficult in the city's sub divided flats, the refugees excluded from the city's vaccination programme, how local mask manufacturers survived in an inundated market, and how local businesses responded to the government mandated tracing app. Beyond politics, we delved into the world of polyamory to explore how some Hongkongers navigate romantic ties beyond traditional partnerships, explored the little known history of siu mai, met the bus fanatics turning Hong Kong bus seats into office chairs, and published a probe into one of the city's oldest sporting associations. We also looked at how a Muslim headscarf sparked a discrimination row at a school and how volunteers helped to restore Hong Kong's Hindu cemetery. 2021 was also a big year for Hong Kong sports. We spoke to local athletes during the Tokyo games to learn about daily life at the Olympic village, as well as to the city's Paralympians about their dreams of sporting glory. We continued to cover environmental and animal stories last year, including the threat to rare porpoises posed by a development off Lantau, and the task force fighting against dog poisonings. Last year, we produced 144 fully fledged features, over 35 interviews, 256 opinion pieces and 276 stories on the 'patriots only' elections. We have also published over 1,000 stories on the national security law, and over 1,000 on Covid 19. HKFP Venture also relaunched with over a dozen guides to outdoor adventures. We expanded our coverage from across the Taiwan Strait, profiling the people fighting for dual citizenship, Hong Kong artists in self exile, the Hongkongers seeking to contribute to Taiwanese society, the launch of an ambitious new English language news platform, and the Hongkongers who have joined the local movement to revive the use of Taiwanese in daily life. We also spoke with the Taiwanese maths teacher posting educational videos on Pornhub, cautiously asking: why? Over the border in mainland China, we reported on a Hongkonger with a history of mental illness who was executed for drug trafficking despite pleas from family and rights groups. And further afield, we reported on the Hongkongers fighting for democracy in Myanmar after the military coup. Explanatory Reporting: HKFP continued its monthly explainer series on how the city has changed under the Beijing enacted security law, and we continued our 'shifting narratives' series on how the city's leaders' attitude towards the Tiananmen Massacre and the traditional mass pro democracy marches on July 1 evolved over recent years. We wrote explainers on major political developments, including how Beijing overhauled the city's electoral system, how authorities moved to erase the memory of Tiananmen, and how the largest teachers' union was forced to dissolve. We also explained how Hongkongers still found ways to resist despite the national security clampdown. HKFP also examined trends in leader Carrie Lam's past policy addresses after she delivered the last one of her current term, analysing what it all meant for the city's future. We broke down how Beijing's overhaul of the city's electoral process ensured that almost every candidate for the new Election Committee was guaranteed a seat. We looked at where Beijing's national security crackdown has left the city's pro democracy camp, and who the approved candidates were in the city's first legislative poll following the sweeping overhaul. Our team also wrote practical guides informing our readers how to sign up for the government's electronic stimulus vouchers, how to enter lucky draws for the fully vaccinated, how to get vaccinated against Covid 19, and how to write letters to prisoners. Interviews: Last year, we touched in again with Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei about what he saw as the future of art in the city. We also spoke with Democratic Party leader Lo Kin hei about the party's future in the shifting political climate, and political scientist Ma Ngok on what Beijing's electoral overhaul means for democracy in Hong Kong. At the other end of the political spectrum, we spoke to the founder of the new pro Beijing Bauhinia Party Charles Wong, and pro establishment lawmaker Michael Tien on the future of Hong Kong politics. We also sat down with pro Beijing figure Adrian Ho about running one of the city's largest pro establishment online communities. We spoke with a number of activists before they were put behind bars, including democrat and labour activist Raphael Wong ahead of his sentencing for an unauthorised assembly, and student activist Wong Yat chin before he was arrested and denied bail under the security law. We also spoke to other dissidents, including former student leader Owen Au about what he saw as the future of protest in the city and investigative journalist Bao Choy after her conviction over accessing public records for a documentary on alleged police collusion with triads. We interviewed dissidents elsewhere in the region, including Singaporean activist Jolovan Wham about his arrest after a one man protest. And during the Tokyo Olympics, we were the first newspaper to catch up with Hong Kong's only gold medal winner, fencer Edgar Cheung, about how he kept calm under pressure. Arts: We also sat down with the city's creatives, including the director of the protest documentary 'Revolution of our Times' Kiwi Chow about why he is staying put in the city, musician Cehryl on the impact of Covid on live music, artist Sampson Wong on finding beauty in Hong Kong, and Yim Chiu tong, the Plumber King, whose advertisements became part of a street art exhibition. In Taiwan, our reporter interviewed the island's only weed lawyer, a politician defending democracy on Matsu island 17 km from mainland China, and dissident Wu'er Kaixi ahead of the 32nd anniversary of the Tiananmen Massacre. And we also spoke with Taipei based singer Kimberley Chen about shrugging off China's censors. Authors: We spoke with journalist and author Joanna Chiu about her new book detailing China's web of influence abroad and Western complicity in China's rise, and veteran journalist Stephen Vines about his last book on Hong Kong before he fled back to the UK. 'Patriots poll: Ahead of the city's first 'patriots only' legislative race, we spoke to three candidates from across the political spectrum including self proclaimed non pro establishment Adrian Lau, Vincent Diu, an electrician who declared as independent, and Nixie Lam, who was seen by her pro establishment supporters as their international spokesperson. After the race, we also sat down with Tik Chi yuen, the only lawmaker elect who claimed to be non pro establishment. Scoops: We broke the story of how mainland Chinese and Hong Kong Wikipedia users were fighting over the narrative of the Hong Kong protests on the site, and the ensuing safety concerns for Hong Kong users. As a result of our report on the Wikipedia wars, the site banned seven mainland Chinese users for 'infiltration and exploitation.' We found Hong Kong public libraries had removed almost a fifth of titles relating to the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre from their shelves since 2009, and that the Bar Association had launched probes into legal icons Martin Lee and Margaret Ng after their convictions for unauthorised assembly. We also broke the story of how city authorities spent millions of taxpayer dollars to lobby Washington against the passing of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. 2020 Achievements NewsStream project complete: In 2019, HKFP won a US$78,400 (HK$615,440) Google News Initiative grant to create an open source funding platform for small newsrooms focussed on nurturing reader membership. The funds went to third party developers to help create NewsStream – a fundraising micro site to reduce barriers and costs for independent news start ups. Our new support.hongkongfp.com site finally launched in 2021, allowing readers to begin, pause and cancel memberships. Redesign & promotion: The launch also included a design refresh across social media and new HKFP Patron promotions by szs.io. 2021 Funding Drive: With an accompanying video, HKFP beat its target of 1,000 monthly Patrons during our #PressingOn Funding Drive. TapNGo: As part of our drive to make it as easy as possible to contribute, we brought TapNGo online, as a new payment method. 2021 expansion: HKFP hired three new staff at the end of 2021 and moved to a larger, private office at The Hive K Town.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/16/hong-kong-equality-watchdog-launches-guide-for-judges-lawyers-to-promote-equal-access-to-justice-for-the-deaf/;2022-11-16 08:30:00+08:00; Hong Kong equality watchdog launches guide for judges, lawyers to promote 'equal access to justice' for the deaf; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit Judges and lawyers in Hong Kong should avoid using 'complex terms' when communicating with people with hearing difficulties, the city's equality watchdog has said as part of guidelines that seek to achieve 'equal access to justice' for the deaf. The Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) on Tuesday rolled out a set of guidelines for people with disabilities, legal practitioners and parties involved in the judicial process, after hearing reports of those with hearing issues running into problems during the legal process owing to misunderstanding or miscommunication. The 38 page guide, which includes general tips for communicating with people suffering from deafness or hearing loss, was designed to be a practical tool for lawyers, judges, judicial officials, court staff and others, said EOC Executive Director (Operations) Ferrick Chu. According to the Census and Statistics Department, the city had 47,900 people with hearing difficulty in 2020, among which 74.8 per cent were aged 70 or above. The watchdog advised legal practitioners to pay attention to the lighting and noise of the surroundings before speaking to someone with hearing difficulties, as well as their distance from that person. They should use a 'natural and normal' speaking pattern and avoid 'complex' terms and language, it said. Local courts should formulate and review policies or practice directions to specify the rights of equal access to justice for those with hearing issues and other people with disabilities. Regular training should be provided to judges, judicial officers and court administrators on the Disability Discrimination Ordinance, especially for staff who provide frontline services to the public, the EOC said. '[T]here is an urgent and paramount need for improving the relevant legal procedures to secure the fundamental rights of persons with disabilities,' Chu said. There was no 'one size fits all' method for communicating with people with hearing difficulties, the EOC wrote. All public institutions in the criminal justice system – including legal aid offices and police stations – should be equipped with as many forms of auxiliary services and technologies possible to meet the needs of the deaf, according to the guide. Asked if the EOC would issue more detailed guidelines for law enforcement officers, Chu said the guide released on Tuesday was aimed at tackling issues flagged to the equality watchdog by people with hearing difficulties. There was not such a need for a separate guide for law enforcement agencies at present, he said. The Judiciary had 17 registered freelance sign language interpreters on its list, the government told the Legislative Council in November 2020. On average, around 100 court cases required sign language interpretation services annually. One complaint surrounding the services of a sign language interpreter was recorded over the past five years, the Judiciary said at the time. The case was handled using the established mechanism and was not substantiated, it said. There was no 'imminent need' to expand the pool of freelance sign language interpreters, the Judiciary said at the time, adding it was not 'cost effective' to hire full time interpreters. Equal Access to Justice for Persons Who Are Deaf and Hard of Hearing: A Guide for Persons with Disabilities  by HKFP on Scribd According to the List of Sign Language Interpreters in Hong Kong released by the Hong Kong Council of Social Service, there were a total of 56 interpreters in the city as of May 21 last year. Among them, only six listed 'court proceedings' as among their sign language interpretation work experience over the past two years. Asked if the Judiciary should consider employing full time interpreters, the watchdog said it was not in a position to give suggestions. The market may be 'too small' for the Judiciary to change the mode of employment for interpreters, Chu said, adding that around 6.3 per cent of the population with hearing difficulties – or around 3,000 people – would use sign language in their daily communication. 'It is a pretty difficult decision,' Chu said, adding there were different variations of sign language which would make it hard to hire full time interpreters. Recommendations made by the EOC on Tuesday centred on improvements that could help people with hearing issues navigate the city's judicial system. Asked if the assistance suggested should be provided to court attendees who have hearing problems, Chu said resources should be allocated to the parties involved in the case first. 'I think we have to prioritise our resources in real life,' he said.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/15/a-true-trailblazer-tributes-pour-in-for-acclaimed-intl-dj-and-producer-janette-slack/;2022-11-15 19:00:00+08:00; 'A true trailblazer': Tributes pour in for acclaimed int'l DJ and producer Janette Slack; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit Hongkongers and the music industry are paying tribute to acclaimed, international DJ and producer Janette Slack, who passed away aged 42 on Sunday. She broke new ground for Asian and female DJs in a competitive, male centric industry. The boss of the Slack Trax label and a composer, Janette was also a music teacher to young Hongkongers interested in mixing. Hong Kong born Janette cut her teeth at London's Torture Garden in the early 2000s. After her residency at the famous fetish club, she returned to Hong Kong to play some of the top clubs, secret shows, warehouses and junk parties. 'Janette was a true trailblazer for women in the electronic music scene – both in Hong Kong, throughout Asia and even in London – and she had an absolute passion for dance music and the scene in general,' said Adam Wright, an event promoter and DJ who worked with Janette over two decades. 'While she was an exceptionally talented DJ and music producer, her friends will remember her best for her infectiously positive attitude, unfailing friendliness and her joyful, warm heart.' 'As happy as she appeared generally, she seemed happiest when sharing her love of music with her young DJ and music production students. It was inspiring how she was able to relate to these youngsters as equals and she took real pleasure in their achievements. They all really looked up to her – as we all did in some way.' Janette was the first female winner of London's Denon DJousts contest, and also won the Armada European Female DJ competition. She collaborated with musical giants such as D. Ramirez, the Preset Warriors, Javone Prince, Kickflip, Fabian, Some DJ and MC Tuhin Chisti, and often appeared on the BBC and on Clockenflap radio. On Tuesday, fans and friends paid tribute on social media, remembering her energetic, outgoing personality, her outlandish outfits, and her support for others in the industry. One friend, Nikki Davies, told HKFP that her friends were numbed by the news, and it left 'a huge hole in our hearts and lives.' In a Facebook post, her brother Trevor said she was the light and soul of the room: 'As hard as this is for me to accept, or any one else for that matter, I know you are at peace.' Wright added that the news was difficult to process: 'Hong Kong has lost one of its brightest stars and right now it's hard to imagine how the city will ever be quite the same. We are all in shock at the loss of this talented artist who inspired us all and enriched our lives, and our thoughts go out to her family in particular.'

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/15/remanding-national-security-defendants-for-long-period-before-trial-not-ideal-head-of-hong-kong-lawyers-group-says/;2022-11-15 18:49:00+08:00; Remanding national security defendantsfor long period before trial 'not ideal,' head of Hong Kong lawyers' group says; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit The president of the Law Society of Hong Kong has said that denying bail to defendants and keeping them in remand for long periods pending trial in national security cases was 'not ideal.' 'These situations where [the defendants] are remanded before trial, or not granted bail, are not ideal. I not only communicated that with overseas friends, but have also told the Hong Kong government multiple times that the situation should be improved,' Chan Chak ming told reporters on Tuesday afternoon. He was meeting the press after recently returning from his first visit to the UK as president of the solicitors' group, where he attended the opening of the legal year in late September. Three vice presidents of the society also attended Tuesday's meeting. 'If a person was found guilty after a court trial, he or she should accept the punishment. If not, of course they should not be remanded,' Chan said. 'Before a sentence is handed down, keeping people behind bars for a relatively long period of time is not ideal,' he added. Defendants charged in national security cases face a stricter bail standard, as they would only be granted bail if the judge believed there were sufficient grounds for believing that the suspect would not continue to endanger national security. As of June 30, 23 per cent of those arrested for national security offences were granted bail. When HKFP asked what concerns people in other countries had towards Hong Kong's national security law, Chan said 'people tend to simplify things' when learning about Beijing's implementation of the security legislation through the news. Chan said there has always been a mechanism in the city's Basic Law to allow national laws to become applicable to Hong Kong for 'things outside of Hong Kong's autonomy, including defence, foreign affairs and national security.' 'When you go through these technicalities, they will start to understand,' he said, adding that 'I am not here to paint a glossy picture of Hong Kong. I'm just telling the truth.'

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/15/autistic-hong-kong-man-sentenced-to-12-months-in-jail-for-sedition-and-inciting-others-to-take-part-in-illegal-assembly/;2022-11-15 18:29:00+08:00; Autistic Hong Kong man sentenced to 12 months in jail for sedition and inciting others to take part in illegal assembly; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit An autistic man convicted under Hong Kong's colonial era sedition law has been sentenced to 12 months in prison after pleading guilty to three counts of doing acts with seditious intent and one count of inciting others to take part in an illegal assembly. Chan Tai sum, 23, appeared in front of Judge Stanley Chan, one of the city's handpicked national security judges, at the District Court on Tuesday. The 23 year old pleaded guilty to the four offences in last month, after Kwok Wai kin, another national security judge, ruled against Chan's barrister's application to move the trial to the High Court. According to the prosecution, Chan incited people to gather in Causeway Bay and Yau Tsim Mong on Christmas Eve by publishing posts on two telegram groups on December 13 last year. Chan was also said to have published multiple 'seditious' posts on online forum LIHKG between August 19 and December 8 last year, including posts where he described the central and Hong Kong governments as 'bandits,' and encouraged people to overturn the 'tyranny' of the Communist Party of China. Chan has autism, and had difficulty in face to face communication with other people, his barrister Steven Kwan said during mitigation. Kwan also said that the 23 year old was bullied during his time in remand. The barrister said that Chan made those posts as an attempt to gain recognition from other people online, as he could not do so in real life. Chan did not give much thought to the posts before publishing them, Kwan added. Citing a Court of Appeal case, Kwan said that the court should take Chan's mental disorder into account when considering his sentence, as the defendant was influenced by his condition when committing the offence. Mitigation letters, including one written by Chan himself, were also submitted to the court. Chan was remorseful, Kwan said, which was shown not only in his mitigation letter but also in his decision to plead guilty at an early stage. Handing down his judgement on Tuesday afternoon, the judge said Chan committed the offence after the implementation of the national security law, which showed that he viewed the Beijing imposed legislation as a 'paper tiger.' 'The defendant having autism is not an excuse to say that he does not understand the legal consequences,' Stanley Chan wrote. The sedition law, while falling under the Crimes Ordinance, shares the same bail threshold as the national security law, and cases under the colonial era legislation are also heard by handpicked national security judges. Kwan's mitigation that the defendant acted alone was also refuted by the judge, who said that the argument was a 'generalisation.' Judge Chan ruled that the defendant could have incited 'lone wolves' who could harm themselves and others, and thus warranted a heavy punishment to act as a deterrent. Judge Chan also said he omitted all 'inappropriate wordings and phrases' in his judgement to avoid publishing illegal messages or insulting words for the defendant again. The judge sentenced the 23 year old to 10 months in prison for the incitement charge, and eight months in prison for the sedition charges after applying a one third deduction for pleading guilty. After ruling that four months of the prison term for the sedition charges could be served consecutively with the 10 month sentence, Chan was sentenced to 12 months in prison, with the judge deducting another two months in light of the defendant's background and mental disorder.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/15/covid-19-hong-kongs-03-policy-is-basically-00-beijing-loyalist-says/;2022-11-15 16:16:00+08:00; Covid 19: Hong Kong's '0+3' policy is basically '0+0,' Beijing loyalist says; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit With Hong Kong under pressure to further ease all Covid 19 entry requirements and adopt a '0+0' arrangement – meaning no quarantine and no self monitoring period for incoming travellers – one Beijing loyalist has said the city has all but embraced the 0+0 policy, just not in name. Under the current '0+3' measure, international arrivals do not need to undergo compulsory quarantine but must adhere to a three day 'medical surveillance' period, during which they are barred from certain venues, such as restaurants, bars and gyms. Inbound travellers must also take and report the results of a total of 11 Covid tests in their first week in the city. Lo Man tuen, vice chair of the All China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, wrote in a Ming Pao op ed published on Tuesday that the central and Hong Kong governments understood people's wishes for a complete relaxation of travel rules. Hong Kong has been 'refining' its 0+3 policy, he said, and trying to eliminate as many restrictions as possible. 'In fact, the '0+3' arrangement we have now is almost like '0+0',' Lo wrote. Lo cited sources who said that retaining the 0+3 measure was a thought out move, as Hong Kong had to 'take the mainland's perspective into consideration.' 'If Hong Kong were to rename its arrivals policy '0+0,' the mainland may think Hong Kong had 'completely lets its guard down.' [If this were the case,] when Hong Kong asks the mainland to make travelling across the border for Hongkongers more convenient, it will be more difficult,' Lo wrote. The Beijing heavyweight added that the central government 'greatly supported' Hong Kong's easing of quarantine measures, and that the city's policy amendments acted as a reference for the mainland. The mainland started to ease some restrictions this month as well, Lo said. On Tuesday, when asked about the government's plan to roll out the 0+0 arrangement, Chief Executive John Lee said he had stopped describing Hong Kong's quarantine policy as 'zero plus whatever.' 'Hong Kong's anti epidemic policy is simple and clear, that is as long as the risks are manageable, we will minimise the restrictions. I will no longer discuss whether that is '0 + whatever.' The important point is Hong Kong does not have a centralised isolation [policy],' Lee told the press ahead of his weekly Executive Council meeting. Lee stressed that any Covid 19 measures were about striking a balance, with the government working to allow social activities. The administration has been urged to scrap more Covid 19 related restrictions, such the group gathering ban and the Vaccine Pass. Public health experts have also called for the number of Covid tests required from incoming travellers to be cut. Hong Kong has reported 1.99 million Covid 19 infections and 10,536 related deaths since the pandemic began.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/15/hong-kong-police-probe-playing-of-protest-anthem-at-rugby-match-in-south-korea-as-lee-links-song-to-violence/;2022-11-15 15:35:00+08:00; Hong Kong police probe playing of protest anthem at rugby match in South Korea as Lee links song to 'violence'; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit Chief Executive John Lee has linked the protest song played ahead of a rugby match between Hong Kong and South Korea on Sunday in the place of the Chinese national anthem to 'violence,' 'disturbances,' and 'advocacy for Hong Kong's independence' during the 2019 protests. Lee's comments came as he addressed the press on Tuesday morning before his weekly Executive Council meeting and hours after the police announced that they were looking into whether the incident involved any breaches of the city's National Anthem Ordinance or other laws, including the national security legislation. 'Glory to Hong Kong,' a tune popular among pro democracy protesters in 2019, was heard at the stadium in Incheon ahead of the men's final between Hong Kong and South Korea on Sunday, instead of the Chinese national anthem 'March of the Volunteers.' Although the protests attracted a handful of pro independence activists, secession was not one of the movement's demands. According to a police statement released on Monday evening, the Organised Crime and Triad Bureau was handling the case. The bureau is mainly tasked with probing 'complex organised crime and serious triad offences,' according to the police website. At his regular meeting with the press on Tuesday morning, Lee said he believed that the force had 'sufficient experience' to investigate the matter. '[T]he song that was played was closely connected to the 2019 violence and disturbances, and advocacy for Hong Kong's independence,' Lee said. 'In fact, it is the organiser's responsibility to ensure that all things are run properly. This of course includes the playing of national anthems of any players who have won the match,' he added. The chief executive said he would ask the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau to work with sporting organisations to make improvements in the area. The city's Chief Secretary for Administration Eric Chan has met with the Consul General of South Korea in Hong Kong over the incident. A press release published by his office said the Hong Kong government 'strongly deplores and opposes' the incident and had requested the Korean side to look into what had happened. While Asia Rugby, the organiser of the Asia Rugby Sevens Series and the governing body of rugby union in the region, has apologised and explained that it was down to 'simple human error' made by a junior member of staff, Chan said the Hong Kong government raised 'strong objection to the association for its inability' to prevent the mistake from happening. The Korea Times on Monday cited a public relations representative from the Korea Rugby Union as saying that the local organiser had asked each country to submit national anthems to play, but had failed to get one from the Hong Kong team. Korea Rugby Union staff 'saved 'the Hong Kong national anthem' listed on the top of a search engine in the file folder named, 'Hong Kong',' the newspaper reported. Although Asia Rugby later informed the Korean organiser that it should play the Chinese national anthem for the Hong Kong team, the mistakenly saved file was not deleted and was delivered to the broadcast team, which resulted in it being played when Hong Kong made it to the final. The Hong Kong government has requested Asia Rugby and the Hong Kong Rugby Union to launch further investigations into the incident.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/15/major-hong-kong-health-care-group-shared-clients-data-among-brands-privacy-watchdog-finds/;2022-11-15 08:30:00+08:00; Major Hong Kong health care group shared clients' data among brands, privacy watchdog finds; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit Hong Kong's largest non hospital medical services provider EC Healthcare shared clients' personal data among various brands owned by the group, the official privacy watchdog has found. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) released the results of an investigation into EC Healthcare at a press conference on Monday, revealing that the group had shared clients' full names, transaction details and medical records among its subsidiaries via an integrated customer service system. The system in question was used by 28 of the 39 brands owned by the group, involving 1.08 million clients. EC Healthcare did not inform all clients or get their consent before disclosing and transferring their personal information, the PCPD office found. The exact number of clients affected was not identified. The customer information in question was made available to EC Healthcare's customer service, cashier, hotline centre and front desk staff via the system. The Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data Ada Chung said the firm's practices were 'disappointing both from the perspective of compliance with legal requirements or that of respecting clients' wills.' She said EC Healthcare contravened the requirements under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance. An enforcement order was issued to the group requesting it to stop sharing customer data without consent, as well as provide training and establish clear boundaries for staff who can access the data. According to Chung, the company has to meet the requirements of the enforcement order within three months or risk a maximum jail term of two years and HK$50,000 fine, with HK$1,000 additional for each day overdue. Chung said that the current punishments were considered 'insufficient.' 'We will work with the government and review the entire privacy ordinance, including its penalties,' she added, without giving a timeframe. The investigation was launched after two separate complaints were filed to PCPD last June and July, respectively. In both cases, brands under EC Healthcare obtained the full names of the complainant or their family members without the customers providing such data. The clients involved had each provided their information to either Primecare Paediatric Wellness Centre or New York Medical Group. The privacy watchdog found that when the two brands were later acquired by EC Healthcare, some of their client data was shared among different companies under the new parent firm using the integrated system. EC Healthcare told the watchdog that the system was set up to 'provide one stop medical and healthcare services, improve the quality of customer services, and make answering client enquiries and handling complaints more convenient for frontline staff.' However, it said that clients' personal data from other companies was not necessary for the individual operation of the brands involved in the complaints cases. Chung said she believed that EC Healthcare's practices were 'not common' in the industry but the watchdog would look into similar large healthcare groups. 'We are monitoring online discussions, news highlights or media reports. If we find there is something irregular in the operation of any particular group  we will initiate enquiries proactively without waiting for any complaints,' she added. PCPD also released findings from an investigation into Fotomax on Monday. The photo finishing service chain suffered a ransomware attack in October 2021, in which the data of544,862 registered members and 73,957 other customers of its online store was maliciously encrypted. The watchdog said the data hack was made possible by 'serious deficiencies.' The company admitted to PCPD that it had learned of a loophole in its firewall in September 2019 but it believed that its existing data security measures were sufficient to fend off related threats and did not install the security patch. Fotomax also delayed the implementation of multi factor authentication as urged by the firewall provider, PCPD found. Chung said the company had contravened the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance as it had not taken all practical steps to ensure the protection of personal data. Fotomax was therefore ordered to hire independent experts to carry out regular assessments of its data security. In addition, Chung said her observations suggested that companies in Hong Kong were aware of the risk of cyberattacks. 'I do believe that this is an isolated incident,' she said.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/14/national-security-police-should-investigate-anthem-error-at-rugby-match-hong-kong-lawmakers-say/;2022-11-14 18:51:00+08:00; National security police should investigate anthem error at rugby match, Hong Kong lawmakers say; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit The national anthem blunder at South Korea's Rugby Sevens has sparked a chorus of complaints from Beijing loyalists, with local lawmakers demanding the national security police to step in and investigate how a song linked to the 2019 extradition bill protests was played instead of China's national anthem. It was 'extremely ridiculous' and 'unacceptable' for organisers of the tournament to mistakenly play 'Glory to Hong Kong' during the men's final between Hong Kong and South Korea, pro Beijing lawmakers said on Monday. The Hong Kong government earlier expressed strong opposition to the mix up, which saw the protest song played ahead of kick off rather than 'March of the Volunteers' – the anthem the city shares with China. Playing a song closely associated with 'black clad violence' seriously violated China's sovereignty and seriously insulted the country, said legislator Michael Luk of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions. It was 'impossible' for such an error to occur, he said, as the Hong Kong Rugby Union (HKRU) had provided the national anthem of China to the organiser. The lawmaker demanded the National Security Department of the police to launch an in depth probe into the incident to see if there was any 'collusion' between Hongkongers or Chinese people and Korean personnel that lead to the playing of the protest song. 'We are very worried that someone would make use of these international tournaments as a platform to collude with foreign forces and spread pro independence messages. Our law enforcement agencies must take action,' Luk said, adding he hoped China's foreign ministry office in Hong Kong would step in and assist in diplomatic negotiations. The unofficial protest anthem occurred at the second leg of the Asian Rugby Seven Series after a junior member of staff mistakenly played 'a song downloaded from the internet instead the correct anthem,' Asia Rugby said on Monday in a public apology to the HKRU and the governments of Hong Kong and China. An apology was also announced in both English and Korean at the stadium in Incheon after the final match and before the prize presentation ceremony, the regional association said. The organisers played 'March of the Volunteers' when the Hong Kong team lined up again and edited online match footage to replace the protest song with the Chinese national anthem, it said. Beijing loyalists in Hong Kong rejected explanations that the incident was an 'honest mistake,' however, with some alleging that it was 'intended' to upset the people of China. The largest pro establishment party DAB said on Monday that the Chinese national anthem was 'widely known in the international community,' and Asia Rugby had made an 'unforgiveable mistake.' 'It makes people suspect that someone intended to stir up trouble and offend Chinese people,' the party said. Starry Lee, chairwoman of the DAB, also called on Asia Rugby to apologise to 'the entire [Chinese] population' and ensure a similar situation would not happen again. Pro Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho hit out at the Hong Kong rugby team for their 'lack of response' when they heard the protest song being played instead of the Chinese national anthem. The players 'let their country be insulted,' he said, adding they had 'lost the confidence' of the people of Hong Kong. 'They have failed completely  the only solution is to disband the Hong Kong rugby team!' the legislator wrote on Facebook. Ho also told online news outlet InMedia that the players should have reacted 'within three seconds' and made hand gestures or shouted to stop the protest song from playing. 'You should make a T sign, [say] 'Stop! Stop! Suspend! Wrong song! Wrong national anthem! This is inappropriate!',' InMedia cited the legislator as saying. 'Glory to Hong Kong' was released in September 2019, around three months after protests erupted in June that year over a since axed extradition bill. They escalated into sometimes violent displays of dissent against police behaviour, amid calls for democracy and anger over Beijing's encroachment. Demonstrators demanded an independent probe into the police conduct, amnesty for those arrested and a halt to the characterisation of protests as 'riots.' When asked by HKFP if the protest song was illegal in Hong Kong, the Security Bureau did not give a clear answer: 'Whether a person or entity violates the law would depend on the actual circumstances of the case, including the facts, the relevant acts and the mens rea, the evidence gathered, etc., and all cases will be handled in accordance with the law,' a spokesperson said. The song is, however, banned in schools and a busker who performed it last year was arrested by police.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/16/hkfp-guide-hong-kongs-new-govt-run-online-booking-system-for-twisk-campsite/;2022-11-16 08:00:00+08:00; HKFP Guide: Hong Kong's new gov't run online booking system for Twisk Campsite; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit All 41 designated campsites in Hong Kong under the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) will finally reopen after being closed for more than two years owing to the Covid 19 pandemic. As members of the public are allowed to set up tents again at specific sites in the city's country park areas starting on Thursday, the government also launched an online booking system pilot scheme for the Twisk Campsite in Tai Lam Country Park to allow advance reservation of camping spots. HKFP explains how to navigate the booking site. Twisk Campsite is located in Tai Lam Country Park near Tai Mo Shan, the highest peak in Hong Kong. You can take Bus 51 (Sheung Tsuen bound) from Nina Tower Bus Terminus in Tsuen Wan and get off at 'Tai Mo Shan Country Park.' From there, it is a five minute walk before you arrive at the campsite entrance. Both Hong Kong residents and non residents are allowed to book a free camping space at the Twisk Campsite. You will be asked to indicate your residential status when you make your reservation. The reservation system is only available to adults, however, as the system asks you to confirm that you are 18 or above on the check in day. The entire Twisk Campsite is divided into five zones with 37 camping units in total – four of them are twin units. A single camping space can accommodate one to four people, while a twin unit holds five to eight people. The government may adjust the maximum number of people allowed per camping unit based on the latest Covid 19 social distancing measures. On the online booking system, you can reserve a camping space for up to two nights, and each applicant can book one unit only. It is possible for campers to extend their stay at the same or a different unit by making another booking for one or two nights after they have checked in. You can stay in the campsite for a maximum of four consecutive nights, subject to the availability of the units. Yes. Once you have selected the dates of your reservation, the system will show you an overview of all the 37 camping units on site. The map also indicates the proximity of individual units to public facilities in the campsite, such asthe shelter, water supply, toilets, refuse collection points and the guard house. Units that are still available will be in green, while the red ones mean they are already taken. Once you have selected the unit you want, the system shows you the location of the unit within its zone, as well as the size and facilities included. For instance, Unit 25, a single unit located at the corner of Zone 3, has a square camping platform that is three metres wide and three metres long. It also comes with a table and bench with a barbeque stove. Campers are allowed to check in between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. Those who arrive after 6 p.m. would be considered 'no show.' Campsite users are required to check out by 11 a.m. on the check out date. Note that the Twisk Campsite is closed for maintenance and cleaning every Wednesday except if it is a public holiday. After you have chosen you desired camping unit, you are required to fill in your name, as shown on your identification document, your identification document number, email address, mobile number and the total number of people who will be camping at the unit. You have to complete the form in 15 minutes. Notes to Campers by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department by HKFP on Scribd You are not allowed transfer your booking to other people. Any fellow campers who are a minor must obtain approval from their parents or guardians to join the camping. Successful applicants receive a confirmation email. When you check in at the Twisk Campsite Service Counter, you will need to present the confirmation email as well as your identity document. You will collect a 'Camper Card' from the counter, which you need to display on the camping platform at all times during your stay. People without a valid card or anyone who fails to be idenitified by a valid cardholder will be asked to leave the campsite. The 'Camper Cards' should be returned to the counter or a drop box upon check out. Yes. You can use the camping gear rental service at the Twisk Campsite Service Counter if you do not have equipment needed for your stay. You will be asked to pay a deposit and sign an agreement. You can cancel your reservation either through the online booking system or in person at the Twisk Campsite Service Counter. If you want to make amendments to your booking, such as changing the date, camping unit or the name of the applicant, you can only cancel your book and submit a new one. The unit you give up will be shown on the booking system as available after midnight on the day of cancellation.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/12/in-pictures-hong-kongs-only-sikh-temple-reopens-as-a-focal-point-for-everything/;2022-11-12 10:00:00+08:00; In Pictures: Hong Kong's only Sikh temple reopens as a place of worship, community and more; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit Holding metal buckets of dal, rice and paneer masala, volunteers offered generous top ups to the stainless steel trays of diners seated cross legged on the floor. Friends, families with children, and construction workers who had just finished a shift nearby were among those tucking into a hearty meal on a November day. The langar, with its bright interior and gilded accents, is the heart of Hong Kong's newly redeveloped Khalsa Diwan Sikh Temple. Offering free vegetarian food to worshippers throughout day, the dining hall is also a place of unexpected reunions and overdue catch ups for the city's 15,000 strong Sikh community. Khalsa Diwan – located in Wan Chai – officially reopened on Tuesday after a five year renovation. Spanning 76,000 square feet, the new four storey temple features a large prayer hall, an upgraded library, classrooms and conference rooms. A medical centre, run by volunteers, is in the works. 'The new temple is much bigger and more organised,' Johnny Johal, who was eating at the food hall with his wife and 12 year old daughter, told HKFP. 'Before the renovation, we used to come here for prayers, but also celebrations like birthdays and weddings.' He added that he imagined he would be a regular at the temple again now that it has reopened, visiting perhaps once a week. Muskkan Samtani and Gulshan Dua told HKFP there was no place in Hong Kong that was quite like the Sikh temple. 'During Diwali,' Dua said, referring to one of India's biggest annual festivals, 'there's the food, the prayers, the candles, the huge tables – it's exactly the way we do it back home.' The pair are volunteers with the temple's digital library committee, helping to source books in English and Punjabi – the predominant language spoken by Sikhs – that aim to teach young children about their religion. 'Many children growing up in Hong Kong do not have much exposure to their culture,' Samtani said. 'They may not understand things like why they need to cover their hair when going to a temple.' According to the temple's website, it is believed that Sikhs first came to Hong Kong around 1840, many of them brought by British colonisers to Hong Kong from India, also part of the British empire, to serve in the police force. The temple was founded in 1901 by the Sikh members of the British Army Regiment in Hong Kong, and was rebuilt after it was bombed by Japanese soldiers in World War II. It holds prayers every morning and evening, with an extra afternoon session on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The temple also offers Punjabi and Sikh literature classes, and there are plans to start Cantonese lessons. Gurdev Singh Ghalib has devoted his days to the temple since retiring six years ago from his chief officer post at the Correctional Services Department. The 61 year old oversaw the temple's redevelopment as convenor of the Building Committee of the Sikh temple. 'This is a focal point for everything,' Ghalib told HKFP, adding that it was a place for 'all ages' from babies to the elderly. In Indian culture, mothers who have just given birth observe a confinement period of 40 days, he said. The custom is similar to the Chinese post partum practice of 'sitting moon.' 'Then they bring the baby to the temple and give them holy water to drink,' Ghalib said. 'And for those who are retired, they can relax here. They can have a cup of tea and sit in the yard, just to kill time.' Back in the dining hall, Rajbir Singh – who had just attended a morning prayer session upstairs – was finishing up the last of his chapati and masala tea. 'After that, I will go do sewa,' he told HKFP as he gestured towards the kitchen, where dozens of volunteers were preparing food, mopping and washing the dishes. Sewa refers to the Sikh concept of providing 'selfless service' at the temple. It comes in the form of volunteering wherever help is needed, whether it is cleaning, fixing appliances or maintenance. The temple employs just 10 staff members, according to Ghalib. In the kitchen, volunteers stirred giant vats of kheer – a type of Indian rice pudding – and cracked open bags of sugar to make masala tea. Others on dishwashing duty dunked trays and utensils into basins of soapy water, their arms lathered in suds. Bally Gill, a volunteer, pointed to a group holding mops and wiping down gas stoves. 'We are the executive cleaning team,' she joked. 'Three times a week, we try to do a deep clean.' 'The cooking is important, but we have to make sure that everything is tidy and hygienic too,' she said, adding that there could be as many as 20 to 30 cleaners volunteering in the kitchen at any given time. The temple, she added, is more than a place of religious worship. 'It gives us a place for us to get together, to do something of purpose.'

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/06/domestic-workers-who-fall-foul-of-hong-kongs-complex-covid-rules-dispute-hk10000-fines/;2022-11-06 10:00:00+08:00; 'I didn't know': Hong Kong's complex Covid 19 rules see domestic workers fined HK$10,000 for missing arrival tests; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit When Anna, a migrant domestic worker, landed in Hong Kong in May, she – like all arrivals to the city – completed a week of hotel quarantine per the Covid 19 rules at the time. Six days later, a friend told her she was required to have taken compulsory Covid 19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests at government centres after leaving her hotel. Anna went to take one immediately, but it was too late. In July, Department of Health officers turned up at her employer's home with a HK$10,000 fine for missing the tests – an amount more than double the minimum monthly salary for domestic workers. 'I didn't do the tests because I didn't know,' Anna, who asked to go by a nickname, told HKFP. 'My agency never said anything, and my employer also had no idea.' Anna is among dozens of domestic workers in Hong Kong who have been caught up in the city's byzantine and ever changing measures for overseas arrivals. When she arrived in May, travellers were required to take daily Covid 19 rapid tests and two PCR tests while in hotel quarantine, as well as further PCR tests on the ninth and 12th day of their arrival. For domestic workers, many of whom face a language barrier and – in some cases – are arriving in Hong Kong for the first time, the convoluted Covid 19 rules are only made more complicated, according to unions and NGOs that have been helping workers like Anna to appeal the fines. The Hong Kong Federation of Asian Domestic Workers Unions (FADWU) told HKFP it had helped 34 domestic workers dispute the penalties. After communicating with authorities, the Department of Health rescinded the fines for 33 cases, while one was still being investigated. NGO Mission for Migrant Workers said it was assisting a further 10 domestic workers who had been fined. Authorities had yet to reverse the penalties for most of them, although the fine was scrapped for one who had completed the tests but used inconsistent forms of identification – namely her passport and Hong Kong identity card – when registering. Upon being issued the penalty, the receiver is given three weeks to pay. FADWU told HKFP that many domestic workers who had tried to appeal their fines before approaching the union had not heard back from authorities. Responding to HKFP, the Department of Health said it had issued over 5,400 fixed penalty notices to 'inbound persons for contravention of compulsory testing notices' from the start of the year until the end of September. In total, 549 fines were dismissed in the same time period. It is unclear how many domestic workers were recipients of those fines. Information about testing requirements is on the government's websites. But the pages are wordy and difficult to navigate, said An An, the organising secretary of FADWU. Authorities also send text messages with reminders of testing dates depending on when an arrival landed, but the language is cumbersome and only in Chinese and English. 'The process is difficult for anyone who travels inbound, let alone migrant workers,' An An said. Some domestic workers did not receive the messages because they did not have Hong Kong phone numbers. In a pre departure health declaration form, they might have written a mobile number from their native country, while others put down their agency or employer's number, An An added. The declaration form does ask travellers to provide a Hong Kong mobile number or a 'non local mobile number that can receive international roaming SMS' to receive 'important SMS notifications' from the government, but activists say it is difficult for new domestic workers to do so. A domestic worker, who asked to be identified by her nickname Iche, told HKFP she arrived in Hong Kong for the first time in June and quarantined in a hotel for seven days. She did not have a chance to get a Hong Kong sim card because, as with all arrivals, she had to go straight to quarantine upon landing. 'My agency didn't tell me I needed a Hong Kong number,' Iche said. 'And the hotel [I quarantined at] didn't remind me about the compulsory testing.' The Department of Health did not respond to HKFP's question about whether it had alternative communication methods for arrivals who could not be contacted. Marites Palma, the founder of activist group Social Justice for Migrant Workers, said some employers had footed the fine for domestic workers and were deducting repayments from their salaries until they have paid it off. Hong Kong's domestic workers earn a minimum monthly salary of HK$4,730, an amount that was increased by HK$100 last month after being frozen since 2019. The fines, she said, aggravate the debt that many workers are in before they even begin their jobs. 'Many workers coming to Hong Kong already owe a lot of money to the agency because they have to pay a large amount before flying here,' Palma added. Different parties including workers' employment agencies, the Hong Kong government and the consulate offices of their home countries should do more to ensure that important messages reach domestic workers, unions and NGOs said. 'The agencies have to inform their employers, because otherwise they may not allow the workers to go out and take the compulsory tests,' Edwina Antonio Santoyo, a board member of the Mission for Migrant Workers, said. 'Or they may not understand the [consequence of missing] the tests.' An An of FADWU said the greatest responsibility lies with the government. She suggested that authorities set up information booths at the airport to inform domestic workers of the rules upon landing. 'The government should print out leaflets in minority languages and give them out at the airport,' she said. Asked how the government was addressing the language barrier faced by domestic workers, the Labour Department told HKFP it posted 'relevant information' on the 'FDH (Foreign Domestic Helpers) Portal,' a multi lingual section on the department's website that lists general information and updates relating to domestic workers in the city. In a four page reply to FADWU seen by HKFP, the Centre for Health Protection said when hotel quarantine was still required, hotels were tasked with distributing 'reminder notes to inbound travellers upon their discharge from the hotels' stating the dates they must undergo compulsory testing. The centre added that the note was 'translated into nine ethnic minority languages.' FADWU and Palma, however, said they were not aware of hotels passing out such notes. An An added that the cases FADWU had received were only the tip of the iceberg, saying it was possible that many domestic workers who received the fines did not have success while appealing and were unaware of where to turn for assistance. 'What we ask is for the government to drop all the fines against migrant domestic workers,' she said.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/05/lets-talk-about-sex-artist-claudia-chanhoi-on-genitals-shame-and-social-media-censorship/;2022-11-05 10:00:00+08:00; Let's talk about sex: Artist Claudia Chanhoi on genitals, shame and social media censorship; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit Claudia Chanhoi is used to being censored. After all, she makes Instagram unfriendly art. Her social media pages are peppered with breasts, bums, penises and vaginas, sometimes euphemistically presented, sometimes explicitly so, but always in a highly stylised aesthetic that favours bold colours and bolder lines. Suggestive subject matter is a Chanhoi signature, regardless of whether she is delving into the disposable nature of contemporary dating or discussing whether we can disassociate body parts from sexual content, and it frequently brings her into censors' line of fire. 'My work used to be censored and taken down from social media a lot because I often feature genitals in my art,' Chanhoi told HKFP. 'Even though I feel it's far from explicit  my work still got censored,' she continued, adding that it left her feeling 'confused' and 'a little bit attacked as a creative.' 'Why is my art shameful or offensive to others, while we see sexualised images of women pretty much everywhere?' Rather than bend to the puritanical will of Behance, Facebook and Instagram, Chanhoi doubled down. 'This is why I have been constantly doing lots of work with genitals or work about sexualisation, because to me, it was a bit like a protest,' she said. Her frank approach to sex and sexual organs is also rooted in rebellion. 'I grew up in a very conservative environment, because I was born Catholic and I also went to Catholic school,' Chanhoi said. 'I feel like the fact that I am so interested in talking about [sexuality] is just because I couldn't.' Born in Hong Kong, Chanhoi's career as an artist took off while she was at art school in Britain. 'Everything came from my university projects,' she said, which were largely focused on the sexual objectification of women. At the same time, she was learning about her area of study outside of the institution. 'I feel like I was constantly seen as a foreign object in the UK,' she said, adding that she has always felt safer in Hong Kong. 'People would cat call me and I would get a lot of comments on the way I look  and also being an Asian woman was  I wouldn't say a scary thing but I always felt like it was quite a dangerous body to be in.' London, Chanhoi said, has progressed since then. Her conservative hometown, however, has not. 'I feel like the world has changed a lot  in Hong Kong, we are still, let's say, 10 years behind.' Chanhoi has worked with Swedish sex toy brand Lelo, which surveyed Hongkongers' attitudes to sex and extras in 2021 and found that 52 per cent of respondents were not open to using sex toys, saying they believed them to be perverted or were afraid of how their partner may react. Despite believing Hong Kong to be buttoned up, Chanhoi said she was 'still quite surprised' to discover how many people held that opinion. 'In 2022  we see sexualised images all the time but when it comes to exploring our sexuality we're just so, I don't know, scared of it or ashamed of it,' Chanhoi said. 'Like it's taboo to talk about it – which it shouldn't be – because we see 'sex sells' everywhere. I just don't understand where that perspective comes from.' 'We're not supposed to be born with shame.' Chanhoi said she believed it was learned behaviour, perhaps from being told not to talk about our genitals as children or being encouraged to address sexual organs by alternative names. 'But then you begin to learn that there's something wrong with them, they must be something bad,' she said. 'This is how we learn that  some of our body parts can be shameful.' Chanhoi explores and subverts this sense of shame in her work, which puts genitals front and centre, always in a playful way. In one diptych pinned to the top of her Instagram page, a cartoonish clitoris appears alongside a pair of testes, a pubic area complete with pubic hair, an Adam's apple and hairy legs. In the caption, she asks: 'Can we start (de)sexualising [body parts] and look at them without shame and disgust?' Although allowed to remain on Instagram, the images were recently removed from Adobe's portfolio style platform Behance. 'They just said something like, nudity is not allowed,' Chanhoi said, her detached tone revealing how familiar she is with this response. 'You know, obviously  But there's no nudity. This is what my art is all about, right, playing around with [that] idea.' 'I am used to being censored so I like to add a little something to see if that will be censored.' On a more serious note, though, Chanhoi said she believed something was amiss in the way we see – or rather do not see – our sexual organs portrayed in the media. 'We can't really separate sexualisation and body parts. Because we associate them with something like porn, but it is not always like that,' she said. 'Lots of Instagrammers post pictures of them being super sexy and super sexualised, but once a genital is featured, it becomes like, 'oh my god, that's so unacceptable we should take it down or remove it',' Chanhoi continued. 'It's just really interesting that one tiny little genital could change so much when we pretty much see soft porn everywhere in the media, or TV shows.' After four years overseas, Chanhoi returned to Hong Kong – a city which, at least at first, was slow to catch on to her provocative style. 'I felt, at the time, people would not be happy with my work, especially in a place like Hong Kong,' she said. But 'that completely changed because of Apple Daily,' she said. In 2019, the pro democracy tabloid – which has since been forced to shutter after top executives were arrested under Hong Kong's national security law and its newsroom was raided by police – interviewed her. That interview 'changed the game completely,' Chanhoi said. 'Their audience was huge, crazily huge. I mean, to be honest, I was not really an Apple Daily reader, but it was so sad to see it shut down like that.' Overnight, Chanhoi said she started being approached by Hong Kong based clients, and found herself with new, Hong Kong based followers. Chanhoi left her job as a brand design manager earlier this year to dedicate herself to her art full time. Still, she said, she often hears that her work is 'a bit too much' or brands will ask her to 'not include the genitals,' while saying 'we still want you to draw something about sexuality.' Most often, the clients expressing such hesitations were those in Hong Kong, Chanhoi said, adding that most of her commissions came from overseas. 'It's just a little bit more conservative here when it comes to sexuality and body parts.' 'In Hong Kong, being an artist can be quite difficult,' she said, adding that she did not see Beijing's plan to position the city as a cultural hub helping emerging artists such as herself. 'Not personally and not professionally,' she answered when asked whether the opening of M+ and other planned museums might have a trickle down effect on the local art ecosystem. Regardless, Chanhoi is keeping busy. She will be speaking on genitals and taboos at the TEDxTinHauWomen event next month and has recently completed a 'really fun' project for a UK based client on the theme of sex and Christmas. 'Cute, sexy illustrations  like a reindeer with a gag,' she said.

According to Immigration Department statistics, Hong Kong saw 10.8 million arrivals in October 2019, but only 318,935 last month. On Tuesday, Hong Kong's John Lee said the city was 'full of life' since the hotel quarantine requirement was axed, adding that overall arrival numbers rose 1.6 times in October compared to September. Since September 26, arrivals no longer need to quarantine in a designated hotel. Instead, they undergo almost a dozen Covid 19 tests and three days of 'medical surveillance,' during which they can leave home but will be restricted from entering premises such as bars and restaurants. Hong Kong still enforces a group gathering limit of 12 in public, makes mask wearing compulsory, and requires tracing apps for entering certain premises such as restaurants. The city is hosting a FinTech event, a bankers' summit and the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens this week, as it seeks to demonstrate it is reopen for business. Since the onset of the pandemic, Hong Kong has seen 10,397 deaths and 1.91 million cases according to the government's Covid 19 dashboard on Tuesday.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/14/hong-kong-demands-probe-as-pro-democracy-protest-song-played-instead-of-anthem-at-korean-rugby-7s/;2022-11-14 18:00:00+08:00; Hong Kong demands probe as pro democracy protest song played instead of anthem at Korean Rugby 7s; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit The unofficial anthem of the 2019 Hong Kong pro democracy protest movement was played instead of China's national anthem at South Korea's Rugby 7s on Sunday, prompting the Hong Kong government to demand a 'full investigation.' Update: National security police should investigate anthem error at rugby match, lawmakers say 'Glory to Hong Kong' was heard around the stadium in Incheon, during the men's final between Hong Kong and South Korea, rather than 'March of the Volunteers' – the anthem the city shares with China. 'The National Anthem is a symbol of our country. The organiser of the tournament has a duty to ensure that the National Anthem receives the respect it warranted,' a government spokesman said in a Monday press release. They added: '[W]e have already written to the Hong Kong Rugby Union last evening demanding them to deal with this matter seriously, launch a full and in depth investigation and submit a detailed report, and convey our strong objection to Asia Rugby, who is the organiser of the Series.' According to the government, Asia Rugby has already apologised, saying a junior staffer made a mistake and the Hong Kong team had provided the correct anthem. When 'Glory to Hong Kong' was played, the Hong Kong team sought to raise the alarm, and – later – organisers made a public announcement to apologise. During the prize presentation ceremony, the correct anthem was played. Footage was widely circulated online overnight, with the Hong Kong team appearing stone faced as the song was broadcast. Asia Rugby appears to have removed its live stream of the event. The government said the song was 'closely associated with violent protests and the 'independence' movement in 2019.' Though the protests attracted a handful of pro independence activists, it was not one of the movement's demands. The Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China echoed the government's condemnation in a Monday statement, saying: 'The national anthem is a symbol of the country, the playing and singing of the national anthem is a solemn ceremony. Athletes representing Hong Kong, China in international games and competitions shall fully reflect this spirit to preserve the dignity of the national anthem.' Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Rugby Union said in a statement: 'The HKRU expressed its extreme dissatisfaction at this occurrence and has received a full explanation of the circumstances that led to this. Whilst we accept this was a case of human error it was nevertheless not acceptable.' The authorities have refused to say if the song is illegal, though it is banned in schools and police have intervened when it is played in public. Protests erupted in June 2019 over a since axed extradition bill. They escalated into sometimes violent displays of dissent against police behaviour, amid calls for democracy and anger over Beijing's encroachment. Demonstrators demanded an independent probe into the police conduct, amnesty for those arrested and a halt to the characterisation of protests as 'riots.' Hong Kong's national anthem law, which criminalises insults to 'March of the Volunteers,' was enacted domestically on June 4, 2020 – violators risk fines up to HK$50,000 or three years in prison. Last week, a citizen journalist was the first to be jailed under the law.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/14/expert-suggests-fewer-covid-tests-on-arrival-hong-kong-health-chief-says-current-system-to-remain/;2022-11-14 14:09:00+08:00;" Expert suggests fewer Covid tests on arrival; Hong Kong health chief says current system to remain"; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit Hong Kong's compulsory nucleic acid tests upon arrival could be carried out less frequently, a government Covid 19 advisor has said. However, the city's health chief said testing requirements are to remain 'at the current stage,' adding that self administered rapid tests are less effective in catching positive cases at the border. Visitors to Hong Kong must fill in a government health declaration form and show a negative rapid test in order to board a flight. Travellers must perform daily rapid tests and four Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests during their first week in the city as part of a 'self monitoring' period. The PCR tests are conducted on the day of arrival – day zero – and again on day two, day four and day six. If any tests return positive results, the visitor will be served with an isolation order. Depending on their living circumstances, they may be forced to go to a government quarantine camp. Local respiratory expert David Hui told the media on Sunday that it remains necessary for authorities to require PCR tests at the border to help monitor for new Covid strains. But he said the frequency could be cut. 'If we look at the imported  positive cases, around 60 per cent were identified upon arrival. The remaining 40 per cent were found during the first to seventh day following their arrival.' Hui added. Using travellers who stay for three nights as an example, Hui said it is only necessary for them to do one PCR test upon entering the city and another afterwards. When asked about Hui's suggestions, the Secretary for Health Lo Chung mau told reporters that the PCR requirements for visitors will remain. Citing the figures of imported Covid 19 cases via the city's airport, Lo said rapid tests could only identify 20.3 per cent of those who returned positive results in PCR tests. 'If there are more statistics proving that other measures are viable, we will absolutely consider [them.]' Lo said. Hui also said the government should consider scrapping the outdoor mask mandate when the winter passes and the public are vaccinated with updated Covid 19 jabs, which will provide better protection against various Omicron subvariants. The government expert advisory said he estimated that the new vaccines will arrive in Hong Kong in January. Hui said it remains necessary for Hongkongers to wear masks in the short term as face coverings have prevented the outbreak of common respiratory viruses over the past two years. Citing Australia as an example, Hui said there was a serious outbreak of seasonal flu during its recent winter, 'as people were not required to wear masks.' Hong Kong's rule mandating mask wearing outdoors came into effect in July, 2020. Those who violates the mandate risk a fixed penalty of HK$5,000. The government has allowed exemptions for those exercising outdoors or in gyms and sport stadiums since May this year, but not for smokers.

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/11/15/business/us-china-g20-meeting-stronger-ties-intl-hnk/index.html;2022-11-15 02:55:00; US China meeting lays groundwork for stronger economic ties;" Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Officials attending the first US China summit under the new Biden administration in March 2021 exchanged undiplomatic words, highlighting a tense relationship between the world's two largest economies grappling with a simmering trade war. Since then, ties between the United States and China have chilled further, particularly after the US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in August. That helps explain why expectations for Monday's meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 summit were set so low. But to the surprise of many, the meeting featured televised images of smiling officials, handshakes, and a commitment to reopening lines of communication on urgent global issues. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who had sparred with his Chinese counterparts at the 2021 summit in Alaska, is now expected to visit China next year. Analysts said the meeting could lay the groundwork for stronger ties between the world's top economic powerhouses. Stock markets in mainland China and Hong Kong were buoyed as a result, with technology giants such as Alibaba

(BABA) and Tencent

(TCEHY) soaring on Tuesday. Speaking after the three hour meeting, Biden described it as an 'open and candid' discussion, saying he planned to manage the China relationship 'responsibly.' 'We're going to compete vigorously, but I'm not looking for conflict,' Biden told reporters. Xi said in a statement the two countries should prevent 'confrontation and conflict.' Both sides would continue discussions on the basis of common understandings already in place and 'strive for early agreement,' he added. Neil Thomas, senior analyst for China and Northeast Asia at Eurasia Group, said the goal of the meeting was to 'build a floor' under declining relations between Beijing and Washington. 'The meeting met or exceeded the low expectations set by the Biden administration and was a mild positive for global stability,' he said. Xi and Biden cool the heat, but China and the US are still on collision course In an official readout, President Biden said the United States and China must work together to address transnational challenges including climate change and global macroeconomic issues including debt relief, health security, and global food security. 'The two leaders agreed to empower key senior officials to maintain communication and deepen constructive efforts on these and other issues,' it said. Ken Cheung, chief Asian foreign exchange strategist at Mizuho Bank, said the meeting was a positive sign that the two sides were keen to find common ground. 'Despite no tangible outcomes, the resumption of China US top leaders' direct dialogue signaled the cooling [of] China US tensions, boding well [for] the China US relationship after the China Party Congress and US midterm elections,' he said. The relationship is at its lowest point in decades, with friction over trade, human rights, and Taiwan fueling fears of a cold war between the two world powers. Last month, the Biden administration imposed unprecedented export controls on China's chip industry, threatening to severely undermine China's high tech ambitions. Although Biden said he and Xi came nowhere near resolving the litany of contentious issues, there was no need for concern about 'a new cold war.' China's real estate crisis could be over. Property stocks are soaring The message was welcomed by investors. Hong Kong's Hang Seng

(HSI) Index rallied nearly 4% on Tuesday, on track to record a third straight day of gains. The index, boosted by China's latest policy shift towards a gradual reopening of borders and a sweeping rescue package for the ailing property sector, has soared 14% since last Thursday. Chinese technology shares, which had been hammered by a regulatory crackdown at home and rising geopolitical tension abroad, led markets higher on Tuesday. Alibaba shares shot up by 11% in Hong Kong, followed by Tencent, which was up 10%. China's Shanghai Composite Index also rose 1.6%, while the tech heavy Shenzhen Component Index added 2.1%. The 'unexpectedly constructive tone' of the Biden Xi meeting has served to boost markets, analysts from the ING Group said in a research report. US curbs on microchips could throttle China's ambitions and escalate the tech war Biden's reiteration of the US position on Taiwan and its 'One China' policy was helpful, they said, as was Xi speaking out against the use of nuclear weapons by Russia. The most surprising development was the planned follow up visit by Blinken to China. 'This was far more progress than we, or indeed most commentators had expected, and dominates what may otherwise turn out to have been a fairly irrelevant G20 summit,' the ING analysts said. — CNN's Betsy Klein, Kevin Liptak, and Jennifer Hansler contributed to reporting.

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/11/14/sport/rugby-hong-kong-protests-china-anthem-south-korea-intl-hnk-spt/index.html;2022-11-14 03:46:00; Hong Kong protest song plays instead of China anthem in rugby final mix up; The Hong Kong government on Monday demanded an investigation after a song associated with the city's pro democracy movement was played instead of the Chinese national anthem before a rugby sevens match between Hong Kong and South Korea. Event organizers played an instrumental version of 'Glory to Hong Kong' as the teams lined up for the men's final of the Asia Rugby Sevens Series in Incheon, South Korea on Sunday. The song, an unofficial anthem of the city's 2019 pro democracy protests, includes lyrics that a Hong Kong court has previously ruled could incite secession – a national security offense. Clips of the incident, in which the team is shown standing to attention on the field as the song plays, circulated widely on social media Monday, threatening to overshadow Hong Kong's 19 12 victory. In a statement, the Hong Kong government said it 'strongly deplores and opposes' the playing of the song, which it said was 'closely associated with violent protests and the 'independence' movement in 2019.' 'We have already written to the Hong Kong Rugby Union last evening demanding them to deal with this matter seriously, launch a full and in depth investigation and submit a detailed report, and convey our strong objection to Asia Rugby, who is the organizer of the Series,' a government spokesperson said, according to the statement. In a statement Monday, Asia Rugby apologized for the incident, saying it 'happened due to a simple human error from a junior member of the local organising committee, playing a song downloaded from the internet instead of the correct anthem.' The match's local organizer, Korea Rugby Union (KRU), told CNN the mistake occurred when a worker searched online for a Hong Kong anthem and added the top result to a folder labeled 'Hong Kong.' The broadcasting room staff played the music file in the Hong Kong folder instead of one labeled 'China,' the organization said. The organizer apologized through the stadium speaker and played the Chinese national anthem at the end of the match, according to KRU. 'Korea Rugby Union will take all measures to prevent a repeat of such an occurrence in future matches,' the organization said, adding that its 'Hong Kong' folder has now been erased. In a statement, the Hong Kong Rugby Union (HKRU) said it 'expressed its extreme dissatisfaction' over the incident to the organizers. 'Whilst we accept this was a case of human error it was nevertheless not acceptable,' the statement said. Last week, a woman who waved a British colonial era flag to celebrate Hong Kong claiming Olympic gold became the first person in the city to be jailed on a charge of insulting the Chinese national anthem.

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/11/11/asia/guangzhou-cantonese-covid-dissent-intl-hnk-dst/index.html;2022-11-12 01:27:00; Chinese are criticizing zero Covid — in language censors don't seem to understand; In many countries, cursing online about the government is so commonplace nobody bats an eye. But it's not such an easy task on China's heavily censored internet. That doesn't appear to have stopped residents of Guangzhou from venting their frustration after their city – a global manufacturing powerhouse home to 19 million people – became the epicenter of a nationwide Covid outbreak, prompting lockdown measures yet again. 'We had to lock down in April, and then again in November,' one resident posted on Weibo, China'srestricted version of Twitter, on Monday – before peppering the post with profanities that included references to officials' mothers. 'The government hasn't provided subsidies – do you think my rent doesn't cost money?' Other users left posts with directions that loosely translate to 'go to hell,' while some accused authorities of 'spouting nonsense' – albeit in less polite phrasing. Such colorful posts are remarkable not only because they represent growing public frustration at China's unrelenting zero Covid policy – which uses snap lockdowns, mass testing, extensive contact tracing and quarantines to stamp out infections as soon as they emerge – but because they remain visible at all. Normally such harsh criticisms of government policies would be swiftly removed by the government's army of censors, yet these posts have remained untouched for days. And that is, most likely, because they are written in language few censors will fully understand. These posts are in Cantonese, which originated in Guangzhou's surrounding province of Guangdong and is spoken by tens of millions of people across Southern China. It can be difficult to decipher by speakers of Mandarin – China's official language and the one favored by the government – especially in its written and often complex slang forms. And this appears to be just the latest example of how Chinese people are turning to Cantonese – an irreverent tongue that offers rich possibilities for satire – to express discontent toward their government without attracting the notice of the all seeing censors. In September this year, US based independent media monitoring organization China Digital Times noted numerous dissatisfied Cantonese posts slipping past censors in response to mass Covid testing requirements in Guangdong. 'Perhaps because Weibo's content censorship system has difficulty recognizing the spelling of Cantonese characters, many posts in spicy, bold and straightforward language ​​still survive. But if the same content is written in Mandarin, it is likely to be blocked or deleted,' said the organization, which is affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley. In nearby Cantonese speaking Hong Kong, anti government demonstrators in 2019 often used Cantonese wordplay both for protest slogans and to guard against potential surveillance by mainland Chinese authorities. Now, Cantonese appears to be offering those fed up with China's continuous zero Covid lockdowns an avenue for more subtle displays of dissent. Jean François Dupré, an assistant professor of political science at Université TÉLUQ who has studied the language politics of Hong Kong, said the Chinese government's shrinking tolerance for public criticism has pushed its critics to 'innovate' in their communication. 'It does seem that using non Mandarin forms of communication could enable dissenters to evade online censorship, at least for some time,' Dupré said. 'This phenomenon testifies to the regime's lack of confidence and increasing paranoia, and of citizens' continuing eagerness to resist despite the risks and hurdles.' Though Cantonese shares much of its vocabulary and writing system with Mandarin, many of its slang terms, expletives and everyday phrases have no Mandarin equivalent. Its written form also sometimes relies on rarely used and archaic characters, or ones that mean something totally different in Mandarin, so Cantonese sentences can be difficult for Mandarin readers to understand. Compared to Mandarin, Cantonese is highly colloquial, often informal, and lends itself easily to wordplay – making it well suited for inventing and slinging barbs. When Hong Kong was rocked by anti government protests in 2019 – fueled in part by fears Beijing was encroaching on the city's autonomy, freedoms and culture – these attributes of Cantonese came into sharp focus. The Communist Party thinks China's prolific censors are not censoring enough 'Cantonese was, of course, an important conveyor of political grievances during the 2019 protests,' Dupré said, adding that the language gave 'a strong local flavor to the protests.' He pointed to how entirely new written characters were born spontaneously from the pro democracy movement – including one that combined the characters for 'freedom' with a popular profanity. Other plays on written characters illustrate the endless creativity of Cantonese, such as a stylized version of 'Hong Kong' that, when read sideways, becomes 'add oil' – a rallying cry in the protests. Protesters also found ways to protect their communications, wary that online chat groups – where they organized rallies and railed against the authorities – were being monitored by mainland agents. For example, because spoken Cantonese sounds different to spoken Mandarin, some people experimented with romanizing Cantonese – spelling out the sounds using the English alphabet – thereby making it virtually impossible to understand for a non native speaker. And, while the protests died down after the Chinese government imposed a sweeping national security law in 2020, Cantonese continues to offer the city's residents an avenue for expressing their unique local identity – something people have long feared losing as the city is drawn further under Beijing's grip. For some, using Cantonese to criticize the government seems particularly fitting given the central government has aggressively pushed for Mandarin to be used nationwide in education and daily life – for instance, in television broadcasts and other media – often at the expense of regional languages and dialects. These efforts turned into national controversy in 2010, when government officials suggested increasing Mandarin programming on the primarily Cantonese Guangzhou Television channel – outraging residents, who took part in rare mass street rallies and scuffles with police. Welsh and Hawaiian were saved from extinction. Other languages might not be so lucky It's not just Cantonese affected – many ethnic minorities have voiced alarm that the decline of their native languages could spell an end to cultures and ways of life they say are already under threat. In 2020, students and parents in Inner Mongolia staged mass school boycotts over a new policy that replaced the Mongolian language with Mandarin in elementary and middle schools. Similar fears have long existed in Hong Kong – and grew in the 2010s as more Mandarin speaking mainlanders began living and working in the city. 'Growing numbers of Mandarin speaking schoolchildren have been enrolled in Hong Kong schools and been seen commuting between Shenzhen and Hong Kong on a daily basis,' Dupré said. 'Through these encounters, the language shift that has been operating in Guangdong became quite visible to Hong Kong people.' How China's new language policy sparked rare backlash in Inner Mongolia He added that these concerns were heightened by local government policies that emphasized the role of Mandarin, and referred to Cantonese as a 'dialect' – infuriating some Hong Kongers who saw the term as a snub and argued it should be referred to as a 'language' instead. In the past decade, schools across Hong Kong have been encouraged by the government to switch to using Mandarin in Chinese lessons, while others have switched to teaching simplified characters – the written form preferred in the mainland – instead of the traditional characters used in Hong Kong. There was further outrage in 2019 when the city's education chief suggested that continued use of Cantonese over Mandarin in the city's schools could mean Hong Kong would lose its competitive edge in the future. 'Given Hong Kong's rapid economic and political integration, it wouldn't be surprising to see Hong Kong's language regime be brought in line with that of the mainland, especially where Mandarin promotion is concerned,' Dupré said. It's not the first time people in the mainland have found ways around the censors. Many use emojis to represent taboo phrases, English abbreviations that represent Mandarin phrases, and images like cartoons and digitally altered photos, which are harder for censors to monitor. But these methods, by their very nature, have their limits. In contrast, for the fed up residents of Guangzhou, Cantonese offers an endless linguistic landscape with which to lambast their leaders. It's not clear whether these more subversive uses of Cantonese will encourage greater solidarity between its speakers in Southern China – or whether it could encourage the central government to further clamp down on the use of local dialects, Dupré said. For now though, many Weibo users have embraced the rare opportunity to voice frustration with China's zero Covid policy, which has battered the country's economy, isolated it from the rest of the world, and disrupted people's daily lives with the constant threat of lockdowns and unemployment. 'I hope everyone can maintain their anger,' wrote one Weibo user, noting how most of the posts relating to the Guangzhou lockdowns were in Cantonese. 'Watching Cantonese people scolding (authorities) on Weibo without getting caught,' another posted, using characters that signify laughter. 'Learn Cantonese well, and go across Weibo without fear.'

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/11/11/asia/hong-kong-china-national-anthem-insult-olympics-jail-intl-hnk/index.html;2022-11-11 03:44:00; Hong Kong jails woman for insulting China's national anthem during Olympic celebration; A woman who waved a British colonial era flag to celebrate Hong Kong claiming Olympic gold has become the first person in the city to be jailed on a charge of insulting the Chinese national anthem. Paula Leung, a 42 year old online journalist, admitted the charge and was given a three month jail sentence on Thursday, Hong Kong's public broadcaster RTHK reported. Leung, who said in mitigation that she had autism and learning difficulties, had waved the flag in a shopping mall where a big screen was showing the medal ceremony following Edgar Cheung's victory in the foil at the Tokyo Olympics in July 2021. Large crowds had gathered to celebrate what was Hong Kong's second ever Olympic gold medal and its first in fencing, but the scene turned rowdy when the Chinese national anthem was played for the award ceremony and some people began booing. Hong Kong, a former British colony, continues to represent itself separately to mainland China at the Olympics despite having been handed over to China in 1997. Cheung's win was seen by many as a breakthrough for Hong Kong's athletes and a rare moment of unity in a city that has been rocked in recent years by anti government protests. But the use of the Chinese national anthem – 'March of the Volunteers' – to mark his victory was controversial as it was the first time the anthem had been used at an Olympics medal ceremony for a Hong Kong athlete. When windsurfer Lee Lai shan took Hong Kong's only other gold, at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, 'God Save The Queen' was played and the British colonial flag of Hong Kong was raised. Pro democracy protesters in the city have occasionally used symbols from the British colonial era to mark defiance against mainland China's increasingly tight grip on the semi autonomous city. Protesters often waved the colonial era flag at the pro democracy demonstrations that took place across the city in 2019, while some of the thousands of Hong Kongers who lined up outside the British consulate to pay their respects to Britain's Queen Elizabeth II following her death in September saw their actions as a subtle form of protest. In Hong Kong, mourning the Queen has another purpose: defying China Public gatherings have been rare since China imposed a national security law in June 2020 to extinguish the increasingly forceful pro democracy protests. That same month, Hong Kong's local authorities brought in legislation that made insulting the Chinese national anthem an offence punishable by up to three years in jail and a maximum fine of $6,400 (HK$50,000). The legislation requires people to 'stand solemnly and deport themselves with dignity' when 'March of the Volunteers' is played or sung. © 2022 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/11/05/asia/hong-kong-reopen-finance-summit-rugby-sevens-intl-hnk/index.html;2022-11-05 19:48:00; Hong Kong says it's back open for business. Will the world buy it?;" At a glitzy finance summit in Hong Kong this week, the city's leader triumphantly told a room packed with top Wall Street executives that the Asian hub was back in business. 'The worst is behind us,' he declared. Two days later, tens of thousands of rugby fans descended on the city's largest stadium for the Hong Kong Sevens, its biggest (and usually booziest) annual sporting event, which had been suspended since 2019 due to political unrest, and, later, Covid 19. The two high profile international events sent a clear message: After almost three years of border closures, mandatory quarantines, and restrictions on businesses and social gatherings, Hong Kong was finally reopening. For much of the pandemic, the semi autonomous Chinese city maintained some of the region's most stringent restrictions, including one of the world's longest mandatory quarantines for international arrivals. With the economy tanking and concerns mounting that Hong Kong was being left behind as the world moved on, the government finally threw open the city's doors in September and ended formal quarantine to the relief of millions of people. 'We were, we are and we will remain one of the world's leading financial centers,' vowed Hong Kong leader John Lee at Wednesday's summit, attended by more than 200 investors from 20 countries. 'You can take that to the bank.' Speaking on Friday ahead of the kickoff of the Sevens, Hong Kong Rugby Union CEO Robbie McRobbie hailed the return of the tournament as a 'catalyst, watershed,' a symbol that 'Hong Kong is still a vibrant, resilient city.' But experts warn the push to revive Hong Kong, while welcome and long overdue, faces many challenges ahead. The past few years of isolation, which coincided with an ongoing political crackdown, have taken their toll, they said. Despite what Lee and other leaders insist, the Hong Kong that's reopening is not the same city the world knew before the pandemic – and the true impact of that change remains to be seen. Last year, as many destinations reopened to travelers and relaxed restrictions, Hong Kong appeared to be stuck in a different reality. Restaurants, bars and gyms were frequently forced to shutter or limit their hours. Residential buildings were placed under lockdown for days. At one point, public gatherings were capped at two people. And most residents didn't leave the city for years, unable or unwilling to spend up to three weeks in hotel quarantine at their own cost upon return. Businesses were hit hard. The Sevens tournament makes up 95% of the Hong Kong Rugby Union's revenue, so 'we've had three years of redundancies and cutbacks,' said McRobbie. Many disillusioned residents chose to leave permanently; this past year, the city recorded its steepest drop in population since records began in 1961. Companies, too, began eyeing other locations – most notably Singapore, Hong Kong's longtime regional rival. Hong Kong's U turn on quarantine is a sign Beijing still needs its gate to the West But Hong Kong authorities, eager to reopen the border with mainland China – which still shows no sign of easing its strict zero Covid policy that aims to stamp out infections – remained reluctant to loosen restrictions for fear cases would spike and close that door. Then, a severe outbreak fueled by the highly contagious Omicron variant at the start of the year put an end to Hong Kong's hope of maintaining zero daily cases. Under mounting public pressure, the government lifted flight bans with certain countries and shortened hotel quarantine in March – but these small concessions did little to lure people back. According to media reports in August, some Wall Street banks warned their executives would only attend Wednesday's finance summit if there was quarantine free travel – a widely speculated factor behind the government's ultimate decision to scrap quarantine. Finance leaders in the city breathed a sigh of relief at the news. 'We've been closed for too long,' said Sebastian Paredes, CEO of Singaporean bank DBS' Hong Kong operations. 'We are beginning to open up following the other parts of the world that have already opened up. And this is a tangible demonstration that Hong Kong is back.' Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia Pacific Economist of French investment bank Natixis, agreed the week's dual big events were 'a big sign of Hong Kong moving away from Covid restrictions to a new world.' However, the remaining restrictions pose a competitive disadvantage. International visitors must take Covid tests for seven straight days after arrival in Hong Kong, and for the first three days are barred from restaurants, bars and gyms. But the testing doesn't stop there – bars and clubs that don't serve food require proof of a negative rapid antigen test from all patrons. A mask mandate – indoors and outdoors – is also in effect, though photos of the finance summit show attendees sitting at tables without face coverings. They included the city's Financial Secretary Paul Chan, who was declared a 'recovered case' by health authorities after testing positive for Covid upon arrival from a trip abroad on Tuesday. These rules are 'still largely prohibiting the overseas travel market,' said McRobbie, the Hong Kong rugby chief. Before the pandemic, roughly half the fans at the Sevens came from abroad; this year, that number is 'negligible,' he said. The long stretch of isolation and financial hardship has also created challenges for companies hoping for a comeback. Many people have left the sports and events sectors in the past few years in favor of more stable jobs, leaving the industry short staffed, McRobbie added. This partial reopening has left the city in an awkward Covid limbo, said Vera Yuen, an economics lecturer at the University of Hong Kong. 'If we want to open up our border with the Mainland China, our restriction is too lenient   so it's not allowed,' she said. 'But then if we want to open ourselves up to the world, we are still too stringent. We are now stuck in between, hoping to see better policies in the future.' Others also warn of growing political challenges. 'Clouds are certainly coming to Hong Kong from different angles,' said banker Garcia Herrero, pointing to the West's response to the sweeping national security law Beijing imposed on Hong Kong in 2020. Under this law, pro democracy activists have been jailed or exiled, independent newsrooms shut down, and former lawmakers targeted. Meanwhile, authorities have changed school curricula to emphasize Chinese history and culture, and pushed greater economic cooperation in the Greater Bay Area, a national scheme to link China's southern Guangdong province closer with Hong Kong and Macao. The law has been widely criticized by foreign governments and human rights organizations, with the United States sanctioning Lee and other top Hong Kong officials over their role in the crackdown. Hong Kong authorities have repeatedly claimed the law has restored order and stability after the city's 2019 anti government, pro democracy protests. For the US and the European Union, the national security law and crackdown represent 'a change in the rules of the game in what was agreed upon,' said Garcia Herrero. Xi Jinping brought Hong Kong to heel. Now he's back in a city transformed These rising tensions could spell trouble for Hong Kong's trade and diplomatic relationships with other countries. Hong Kong is afforded more freedoms than other Chinese cities, thus has long been seen as a gateway between the mainland and the West – a position that looks increasingly precarious as its civil liberties erode. 'The West would now understand that Hong Kong is not only part of China, but it's closer to China than before,' said Yuen, the economics lecturer. 'The worst scenario is that the West would treat Hong Kong as the same as the mainland China, and then Hong Kong would suffer the kind of sanctions.' And this drawing closer together is likely to continue. In an effort to stem the brain drain, the government is spending 30 billion Hong Kong dollars ($3.8 billion) to draw in global businesses and fresh talent – which Yuen said is expected to 'attract a lot of mainland workers' who may be eager to escape an even more dire job market across the border. Despite these geopolitical frictions, some argue Hong Kong's innate advantages will allow a revival – even if the city is heading in a different direction than before. Asia doesn't have many other financial centers that can match Hong Kong's open regulatory environment, low salaries tax and existing financial infrastructure – 'therefore, even if the image may be tarnished a little bit, there are not many other places to go,' said Garcia Herrero. Yuen echoed this point, saying the city's proximity to China remains appealing to businesses and investors hoping to tap into the vast and lucrative mainland market. 'We can plug into China and sort of maintain the status as having a little bit of autonomy, and (being) different from them, given different Covid policies and (systems of) governance,' she said. But, both experts acknowledged, the path forward is now fraught with new risks. International businesses may come to Hong Kong, but be warier in how much they invest in the city, keeping in mind the threat of US sanctions and regional conflict. Today's Hong Kong is increasingly under Beijing's control, with China growing more assertive on the world stage as leader Xi Jinping enters a third term in power surrounded by loyalists. Those rising tensions between China and its rivals have caused growing divides 'as the world deglobalizes,' said Garcia Herrero – effects that inevitably spill over into Hong Kong, caught in the middle. 'It will never be, in my opinion, what it used to be in terms of the openness of Hong Kong to both the West and the East,' she said.

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/11/04/investing/china-hong-kong-stocks/index.html;2022-11-04 08:41:00; Stocks in Hong Kong log best week in more than a decade;" Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Global investors have two big questions on their minds: When will the Federal Reserve become less aggressive in its campaign against inflation? And does Beijing plan to ease its strict 'zero Covid' policy any time soon? Markets were disappointed this week when the Fed indicated it could push interest rates even higher than previously expected, weighing on stocks in the United States and Europe. But in Asia, investors have been getting excited over speculation that coronavirus restrictions in China could be eased. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index

(HSI) soared more than 5% on Friday and finished the week up 8.7%, logging its biggest gain since 2011. China's Shanghai Composite

(SHCOMP) rose 5.3% this week, its best performance in more than two years. The rallies followed steep sell offs in the wake of China's Communist Party Congress last month. Investors were disappointed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping did not unveil stronger measures to combat a sharp economic slowdown. He also offered no signs the country would move away from its rigid approach to containing the spread of Covid 19, which has choked off growth. In recent days, lockdowns have caused significant disruption for Apple

(AAPL) supplier Foxconn and Disney

(DIS), as well as car makers and fast food restaurants. David Chao, global market strategist for Invesco Asia Pacific, said some of this investor angst appears to have lifted. 'There is so much pessimism and negativity surrounding China, surrounding Chinese growth, and I think a lot of that has already been discounted,' Chao said. Getting past the party congress has eliminated a key source of uncertainty, he added. Social media chatter that China could reopen its border with Hong Kong soon fed market optimism on Friday, as did a report from Bloomberg that US auditors had finished an inspection of Chinese firms ahead of schedule. The Hang Seng shot up 5.4%, while the Shanghai Composite gained 2.4%. Health officials in China have scheduled a press conference for Saturday amid growing frustration and resentment toward zero Covid rules and resulting lockdowns. 'The risk, of course, is there could be some disappointment here,' said Mitul Kotecha, head of emerging market strategy at TD Securities, speaking of the potential for looser coronavirus restrictions. 'There's only rumors and speculation at the moment.' Stocks in China and Hong Kong have been battered this year as investors have weighed darkening prospects for China's economy. The country, a crucial engine of global growth, has been slammed by a crisis in its real estate sector. At the same time, Beijing's Covid approach continues to hurt businesses and crimp consumer spending. The International Monetary Fund estimates that China's economy will expand by just 3.2% in 2022 and 4.4% in 2023, a big decline from the 8.1% growth it notched in 2021. The Hang Seng has plummeted 31% year to date, compared to a 22% drop in the S&P 500. The Shanghai Composite is 16% lower in 2022. Chao said investors have had to contend with the notion that China could grow much more slowly as it tries to reduce its reliance on debt and as investment declines in the real estate sector, which has recently accounted for as much as 30% of gross domestic product. 'We're not going to see that type of investment led economic growth over the next 10 years,' Chao said. But, he emphasized, that's not necessarily a bad thing, as growth starts to look more sustainable. And even if China's economy is growing just 3% or 4%, that will look much better than Europe and the United States, which are at risk of recession. 'From what I see, it's apparent to me that there is capital on the sidelines,' Chao said. 'There are investors waiting to jump back in to the China story.' — Steven Jiang contributed reporting.

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/11/02/business/hong-kong-finance-summit-john-lee-intl-hnk/index.html;2022-11-02 08:39:00; 'The worst is behind us': Hong Kong hosts top global bankers for finance summit;" Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hong Kong leader John Lee sought to drum up confidence in the city's future as a global financial hub on Wednesday, as he welcomed some of Wall Street's top executives to its biggest international event in years. Speaking at an investment summit that has attracted more than 200 participants from 20 countries, the city's chief executive said that it was 'opening once again' for international business after more than two and a half years of arduous pandemic restrictions. As he addressed some of the executives in attendance, including Goldman Sachs

(GS) CEO David Solomon, Morgan Stanley

(MS) CEO James Gorman, UBS

(UBS) chairman Colm Kelleher, HSBC

(HSBC) CEO Noel Quinn and Standard Chartered

(SCBFF) CEO Bill Winters, the government leader was insistent in reaffirming his intention to keep the former British colony competitive for global finance. 'We were, we are and we will remain one of the world's leading financial centers,' Lee vowed. 'You can take that to the bank.' From Apple to Disney, China's Covid curbs are again hurting business Lee also sought to reassure executives that Hong Kong would maintain a distinct role to that of mainland China, saying that central government officials had outlined their support for the city retaining its unique position as a gateway between East and West. China's latest five year plan includes goals to reinforce the city's role as an international trade, financial, shipping and aviation center, Lee said. 'The worst is behind us.' Solomon, Gorman and Kelleher, who took to the stage for a panel shortly after Lee's remarks, did not comment directly on the city's reopening. But Kelleher noted that 'whilst we're all very pro China,' the bank was 'waiting for zero Covid to open up in China and see what will happen.' In September, Hong Kong lifted quarantine requirements that had largely isolated the city, choked economic activity, and fueled a historic brain drain. Mainland China, however, still has a mandate in place for most inbound travelers to self isolate for at least seven days, under its stringent 'zero Covid policy.' That contrast was highlighted Wednesday as mainland Chinese officials — including People's Bank of China Governor Yi Gang — addressed the conference in pre recorded video remarks, rather than attending in person. America's top bankers are more worried about the state of the world than recession Hong Kong's economy is heavily reliant on financial services. In 2020, the sector contributed $76 billion — approximately 23% of its GDP, Lee said. In an interview with CNN Business, DBS Hong Kong CEO Sebastian Paredes called the show of support from the city's top brass 'a tangible demonstration that Hong Kong is back.' 'The people that have flown into Hong Kong — the global CEOs of insurance firms and private equity companies and banks and the rest — demonstrate that Hong Kong is a very important international financial center,' he said. 'We've been closed for too long,' he added, noting that some restrictions remain, including controls on the border with mainland China. 'But as we progress, at least we are opening internationally,' said Paredes. 'We are hopeful.' Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/10/25/investing/china-yuan-all-time-low-xi-jinping-third-term-intl-hnk/index.html;2022-10-25 04:44:00; China's yuan tumbles amid fears about Xi's third term;" Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News China's yuan tumbled on Tuesday to its lowest level in nearly 15 years on Tuesday as investors fled Chinese assets amid fears about Xi Jinping's dramatic move to tighten his grip on power in a major reshuffle of Communist Party leaders On the tightly controlled domestic market, the yuan dropped sharply, hitting the weakest level since late 2007. It was last down 0.6% at around 7.3 per dollar. The currency has lost 15% against the US dollar this year. In trading outside of mainland China, the yuan briefly plunged to around 7.36 per dollar early Tuesday, the lowest level on record, according to Refinitiv, which has data going back to 2010. It later pared losses, trading at 7.33 by 3:35 p.m. Hong Kong time (3.35 a.m. ET). The currency was pegged at 8.28 to the US dollar for years until 2005 when China moved to a 'managed floating exchange rate.' It then appreciated steadily, climbing to a peak of nearly 6.01 in 2014. Hong Kong stocks plunge 6% as fears about Xi's third term trump China GDP data The declines came alongside a historic market rout for Chinese assets worldwide. On Monday, Chinese stocks plummeted in Hong Kong and New York, wiping out billions of dollars in market value. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng

(HSI) Index closed down 6.4%. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index, which tracks many popular Chinese companies listed on Wall Street,dived more than 14%. On Tuesday, the Hang Seng

(HSI) slipped further and was down 0.2% in afternoon trading. The huge sell offs came just days after the ruling Communist Party unveiled its new leadership for the next five years. In addition to securing an unprecedented third term as party chief, Xi packed key positions with staunch loyalists. A number of senior officials who have backed market reforms and opening up the economy were missing from the new top team, stirring concerns about the future direction of the country and its relations with the United States. International investors spooked by the outcome of the leadership reshuffle dumped Chinese assets despite the release of stronger than expected Chinese GDP data on Monday. They're worried that Xi's tightening grip on power will lead to the continuation of Beijing's existing policies and further dent the economy, which despite the rebound last quarter is still growing way below the official 5.5% target for this year. China's leadership reshuffle 'sparked worries about the continuation of market unfavourable policies and increasing risk of policy mistakes under President Xi's power domination in coming years,' said Ken Cheung, chief Asian forex strategist at Mizuho Bank. 'Foreign investors took action to cut their exposure on Chinese assets,' he said, adding that the Chinese currency was faced with mounting capital outflow pressure. The Chinese yuan, together with other major global currencies, has weakened rapidly against the dollar in recent months. The greenback has surged to the highest level in two decades against a basket of major counterparts, boosted by a hawkish Fed that attempts to contain runaway inflation. The yuan is on track to log its worst year since 1994 — when China devalued its currency by 33% overnight as part of market reforms. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Foreign investors spooked by the outcome of the Communist Party's leadership reshuffle dumped Chinese equities and the yuan despite the release of stronger than expected GDP data. They're worried that Xi's tightening grip on power will lead to the continuation of Beijing's existing policies and further dent the economy. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng

(HSI) Index plunged 6.4% on Monday, marking its biggest daily drop since November 2008. The index closed at its lowest level since April 2009. The Chinese yuan weakened sharply, hitting a fresh 14 year low against the US dollar on the onshore market. On the offshore market, where it can trade more freely, the currency tumbled 0.8%, hovering near its weakest level on record, even as the Chinese economy grew 3.9% in the third quarter from a year ago, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Economists polled by Reuters had expected growth of 3.4%. The sharp sell off came one day after the ruling Communist Party unveiled its new leadership for the next five years. In addition to securing an unprecedented third term as party chief, Xi packed his new leadership team with staunch loyalists. A number of senior officials who have backed market reforms and opening up the economy were missing from the new top team, stirring concerns about the future direction of the country and its relations with the United States. Those pushed aside included Premier Li Keqiang, Vice Premier Liu He, and central bank governor Yi Gang. 'It appears that the leadership reshuffle spooked foreign investors to offload their Chinese investment, sparking heavy sell offs in Hong Kong listed Chinese equities,' said Ken Cheung, chief Asian forex strategist at Mizuho bank. The GDP data marked a pick up from the 0.4% increase in the second quarter, when China's economy was battered by widespread Covid lockdowns. Shanghai, the nation's financial center and a key global trade hub, was shut down for two months in April and May. But the growth rate was still below the annual official target that the government set earlier this year. 'The outlook remains gloomy,' said Julian Evans Pritchard, senior China economist for Capital Economics, in a research report on Monday. Xi Jinping enters third term as China's most powerful leader in decades surrounded by loyalists 'There is no prospect of China lifting its zero Covid policy in the near future, and we don't expect any meaningful relaxation before 2024,' he added. Coupled with a further weakening in the global economy and a persistent slump in China's real estate, all the headwinds will continue to pressure the Chinese economy, he said. Evans Pritchard expected China's official GDP to grow by only 2.5% this year and by 3.5% in 2023. Monday's GDP data were initially scheduled for release on October 18 during the Chinese Communist Party's congress, but were postponed without explanation. The possibility that policies such as zero Covid, which has resulted in sweeping lockdowns to contain the virus, and 'Common Prosperity' — Xi's bid to redistribute wealth — could be escalated was causing concern, Cheung said. 'With the Politburo Standing Committee composed of President Xi's close allies, market participants read the implications as President Xi's power consolidation and the policy continuation,' he added. Mitul Kotecha, head of emerging markets strategy at TD Securities, also pointed out that the disappearance of pro reform officials from the new leadership bodes ill for the future of China's private sector. Xi Jinping's speech: yes to zero Covid, no to market reforms? 'The departure of perceived pro stimulus officials and reformers from the Politburo Standing Committee and replacement with allies of Xi, suggests that 'Common Prosperity' will be the overriding push of officials,' Kotecha said. Under the banner of the 'Common Prosperity' campaign, Beijing launched a sweeping crackdown on the country's private enterprise, which shook almost every industry to its core. 'The [market] reaction in our view is consistent with the reduced prospects of significant stimulus or changes to zero Covid policy. Overall, prospects of a re acceleration of growth are limited,' Kotecha said. On the tightly controlled domestic market in China, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index dropped 2%. The tech heavy Shenzhen Component Index lost 2.1%. The Hang Seng Tech Index, which tracks the 30 largest technology firms listed in Hong Kong, plunged 9.7%. Shares of Alibaba

(BABA) and Tencent

(TCEHY) — the crown jewels of China's technology sector — both plummeted more than 11%, wiping a combined $54 billion off their stock market value. The sell off spilled over into the United States as well. Shares of Alibaba and several other leading Chinese stocks trading in New York, such as EV companies Nio

The prominent sight of the 465 foot (141 meter) multi deck Nord in the city's Victoria harbor in recent weeks had sparked criticism from the US State Department, which questioned the 'transparency' of the financial hub and warned of reputational risks. Mordashov, a billionaire close to President Vladimir Putin, was among a number of Russians sanctioned by the United States and European Union – but not the United Nations – after Russia's invasion of Ukraine for their links to Putin. While a number of Russian superyachts have been seized or denied entry in Europe and other jurisdictions, the Nord was left undisturbed in Hong Kong after its arrival on Oct. 5. Superyacht linked to Russian billionaire mysteriously shows up in Hong Kong Valued at over $500 million, it arrived via a seven day voyage from Vladivostok in Russian Far East, down through the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea. The Hong Kong Marine Department later confirmed that the Nord had departed Hong Kong on Thursday but said it could not comment further. The MarineTraffic site put the vessel southeast of Hong Kong waters early on Thursday evening, heading into the South China Sea. A witness saw a fuel barge alongside the vessel inside the harbor at noon. Hong Kong's leader John Lee said on Oct. 11 the city's authorities would not act on unilateral sanctions imposed on Mordashov by individual jurisdictions. 'We cannot do anything that has no legal basis,' said Lee, who himself has been sanctioned by the US for his role on a crackdown on local freedoms. Lee, who is due to host an international investment summit in November with global business leaders, said the Chinese ruled city would only abide by United Nations sanctions. © 2022 Cable News Network.

Photo: RTHK A green group on Wednesday called on government departments to set their own carbon emission targets and lay out a more comprehensive roadmap to carbon neutrality.

In its latest study, Greenpeace spoke to 74 departments in September about their carbon emission efforts, and examined Environmental Performance Reports released in 2021 by 44 of them.

While the government's target is for Hong Kong to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050, the study found that none of its departments had set quantifiable emission targets or a timetable for carbon neutrality.

'Actually there are so many measures they can do. I would say that after how many years of promoting carbon neutrality, they know how to do it, said Greenpeace campaigner Tom Ng.

'They know what kind of measures are needed, but they also need to show the public what are their goals, and when are they going to achieve those goals.'

Ng also called some carbon reduction policies covered in the government reports 'out of date', saying some of them have been in place for almost a decade.

He said that for example in one of the latest reports, using lead free petrol was mentioned as an environmental initiative, despite leaded petrol being banned since 1999. 

Ng urged the government to roll out up to date environmental policies to realise its carbon neutral goal by 2050.

File photo: AFP An appellate court on Wednesday upheld a decision to allow a veteran British lawyer to defend media tycoon Jimmy Lai in his upcoming national security trial. 

Lai, 74, had earlier been granted permission by High Court Judge Jeremy Poon to engage King's Counsel, Timothy Owen, in the trial that is scheduled to begin on December 1. 

The Secretary for Justice subsequently appealed against the admission of Owen, arguing that his involvement will not add any significant dimension to the trial. 

The government had argued that Owen did not have the expertise or experience in issues concerning the offences that Lai was charged with under the national security law – which it said was tailored to Hong Kong's unique constitutional framework. 

As for another charge of printing and distributing seditious publications brought against Lai under the Crimes Ordinance, the government said there is already 'substantial experience' among local barristers to handle it. 

But a three judge panel rejected the government's grounds. 

In a written judgment, the panel said the decision to admit Owen had balanced different aspects, including the novelty and the great general public importance of the legal issues involved, the unusual difficulty and complexity of the case, and its substantial impact on the development of Hong Kong law. 

The appellant court said 'the unique context of the national security law' should not take precedence over other aspects of public interest when it comes to the admission of overseas counsels. 

The judges added that the public's perception of fairness in the trial is of vital importance to the administration of justice, adding that Owen should be admitted on grounds of public perception as well. 

Lai, the founder of the now defunct Apple Daily newspaper, will face trial for allegedly taking part in a conspiracy to print, publish, sell, offer for sale, distribute, display and/or reproduce seditious publications, as well as conspiring with others to collude with a foreign country or external elements to endanger national security.";Radio Television Hong Kong

Police said they've arrested a teacher at a special needs school in Tai Po on Monday for allegedly falsely accusing her colleagues of abusing students. 

The force said the 48 year old teacher of Hong Chi Pinehill No.2 School is suspected to have sent anonymous letters to parents, the school's managing body as well as the Education Bureau, falsely claiming that a number of teachers had abused students.

Chief Inspector Mo Siu hei said upon receiving reports in August, officers conducted a thorough probe into the matter and found the allegations to be exaggerated and false. 

Mo added that some of the video clips that came with the letters were recorded four to eight years ago. 

'After investigating [the case], it was found that some of the accused staff in the clip was not present at the time,' he said.

CUHK last month reverted back to the old emblem after a public backlash, with some lawmakers arguing that the saga was a case of poor governance. 

Responding to a question in the Legislative Council, Choi said the university formed a committee on the emblem in accordance with the law, adding that the government doesn't interfere in CUHK's internal decisions because of institutional autonomy.

So it's not the case that the committee made its own decisions. It had to report to the governing council via the vice chancellor, she told lawmakers, adding that people can take such matters to court if they suspect a breach of regulations.

Business and Professionals Alliance lawmaker Priscilla Leung accused Choi of dancing around the issue, alleging that the governing council had failed in its supervisory role regarding the emblem change.

Leung claimed that a low percentage of outsiders on CUHK's council has caused poor governance, citing government figures as saying that outsiders make up more than half of the members of several university councils in Hong Kong, but just 17 percent at CUHK.

Choi, however, stressed that the composition of the university councils is related to the different history and development of the institutions.

The minister said it's normal for stakeholders to have different views about university governance, but they should have frank exchanges with the university for the overall interests of all sides. 

Leung, who said she was not happy with Choi's answers, also complained that three lawmakers who are CUHK council members do not have the power to ensure an item is discussed by the governing body.

The existing [CUHK] ordinance has given too much discretion for a publicly funded university, and I believe it has provided a lot of loopholes for the CUHK management to disregard the opinion of the council, she told reporters.

The lawmaker said she plans to invite CUHK management to a Legco panel meeting next month to discuss the institution's governance.";Radio Television Hong Kong

Image: Shutterstock An anti tobacco advocate on Wednesday hailed the work of Hong Kong in bringing down the city's smoking rate over the past 40 years, but said more needs to be done to further deter people from lighting up. 

Dr Judith Mackay, director of the Asian Consultancy on Tobacco Control, told RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme that the city had performed remarkably well, passing a slew of legislation and raising the tobacco tax. 

But Mackay said the government needs to bring in further measures as there are still hundreds of thousands of smokers in the territory. 

She threw her support behind a proposal by the government to continuously raise the city's legal smoking age, saying studies show the average age to take up the habit is under 20, when youngsters' brains are still not fully developed. 

So if we can prevent people from starting smoking until they're 23 or 24, then they're most unlikely to start, Mackay said.

The expert added that raising the tobacco tax is also crucial in discouraging youngsters to smoke. 

They just simply can't afford expensive cigarettes. It's as simple as that. So it's not health education in schools, it's actually a fiscal measure that really helps them stop. And we haven't had a tax increase, inexplicably, we haven't had a tax increase since 2014, Mackay said.

On an RTHK programme, Yeung noted that children as young as six months can now receive a diluted version of the BioNTech vaccine, as an alternative to the Sinovac jab that was already available.

As at 7pm on Tuesday, 750 bookings were made for the toddler formula of the BioNTech vaccine. She said the number of bookings for child jabs has not been satisfactory.

'The vaccination rate for children aged below three is lower than 19 percent. It is very worrying. In particular for parents who plan to take their children on holiday during Christmas or the Lunar New Year, they should really have their kids vaccinated,' she said, adding that the government does not have a target as to how many young children it wants to see inoculated against the coronavirus.

The minister said while there's no walk in arrangement for the BioNTech toddler jabs, she believes parents can easily make a booking for the same day as there are still many free slots at the moment. 

On the same programme, the chairwoman of the Subsidised Primary School Council, Vu Im fan, said primary schools are making preparations to resume full day classes.

File image: Shutterstock An advisory panel said late on Monday that it would recommend that the government authorise the use of an updated version of a Covid vaccine targeting the Omicron Covid variant.

The administration welcomed the recommendation from the Advisory Panel on Covid 19 Vaccines and said Secretary for Health Lo Chung mau would come to a decision as soon as possible on the use of the updated BioNTech vaccine. 

Panel members considering the application from distributor Fosun Pharma said they believed that the benefits of authorising the updated vaccine for emergency use outweigh the risks.

They've suggested adding conditions to the approval, including requiring the drug manufacturer to continue providing the latest clinical data, safety update reports, and quality certification documents for each batch of vaccines.

Other government advisers had earlier recommended that the updated vaccine, known as a bivalent jab, would be suitable as an alternative for booster doses for people aged 12 and above.

The jab targets the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 variants, but experts say it may trigger broader immunity against different strains compared to the original version.

His comments came after certain rules were waived for last week's Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit and the Hong Kong Sevens.

'For activities, particularly large scale [ones] with economic elements, and also international events, we will, while controlling the risk, allow them to happen with specific plans,' Lee said ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting. 

The government announced on Monday that inbound tour groups will soon be allowed to visit attractions and eat at designated restaurants as soon as they arrive in the SAR, despite the three day amber health code for arrivals which usually bans such activities.

Lee was asked when individuals coming to the territory will also be able to eat out and enter various venues in their first few days here.

'As we go through more and more activities, we can of course review the experience, and then look at the data, so that we can have more measures designed, so as to allow activities to proceed with the maximum of freedom,' he said.

But the CE said some Covid measures must remain in place as safeguards: 'Masks will stay on, because I think all experts have indicated that masks are important to control the spread of the disease.'

'After all, we have to be conscious of some of the uncertainties of Covid. First of all, we know every now and then, there will be variants. And we also know that with winter coming, the attack of the flu will add to the risk of Covid,' he said.

File image: Shutterstock Amber health code restrictions for arrivals to Hong Kong are to be relaxed allowing visits to restaurants and other places – but only for those in tour groups.

Officials are also considering reducing the amount of Covid tests people on short trips to the city have to undergo.

In a statement on Monday, the government said inbound tour groups accompanied by licensed guides will be permitted to go to attractions such as theme parks, museums and temples as soon as they arrive in the city. 

They will also be allowed into designated restaurants, but will have to dine in partitioned areas.

The amber code that arrivals are given for their first three days in Hong Kong bars them from going to restaurants and other places where people have their vaccination records scanned. 

The government said easing the rules for those on tours can support the gradual resumption of the inbound travel market in an orderly manner, and provide a more favourable business environment for the travel trade. 

It added that it will hold discussions with the Travel Industry Council (TIC) on which attractions should be covered under the new arrangement, which will begin some time this month.

The statement also said the government is exploring whether it is permissible to allow inbound tour groups to take fewer Covid tests during their stay, while balancing the epidemic risks.

Both the tourism sector and catering businesses welcomed the news. 

At a press conference held soon after the government's announcement, lawmaker Tommy Cheung who represents the catering sector said restaurants are ready to start discussing the details with the authorities on how to accommodate tour groups. 

The TIC's executive director, Fanny Yeung, said the move sends a message to the rest of the world that Hong Kong is back to normal. 

'We won't expect a lot of tourists in the beginning of this relaxation. But I think this is a very important positive sign to the world that Hong Kong is back,' she said. 

'So, our tourists, next time  not only the tourists, but even our overseas trade partners, when they plan for the next trip, put Hong Kong as their priority destination.'

Yeung said the council has proposed a list of attractions, including the M+ Museum and the Big Buddha statue, to be included in the new arrangements.

Meanwhile, the Tourism Board (HKTB) also welcomed the government's announcement, saying it expects the measure to gradually bring in more tourists.

'The new arrangements mark Hong Kong's resumption to normality and send a positive message to travellers and our trade partners around the world. It is expected that the specific arrangements can help gradually attract leisure travellers to visit Hong Kong again, especially consumers in short haul markets,' HKTB chairman Pang Yiu kai said. 

'The HKTB will continue to work with the Government, the tourism industry, and related sectors to demonstrate Hong Kong's diverse tourism appeal to ramp up travellers' interests in visiting the city, so as to drive the revival of tourism in Hong Kong.'

Photo: RTHK The High Court on Monday rejected an appeal by former RTHK freelance producer Bao Choy against her conviction for making false statements when accessing a government vehicle registration database.

Choy was fined HK$6,000 last year for the breach, which took place as she investigated the 2019 Yuen Long gang attack. 

Handing down his verdict, judge Alex Lee said Choy's intention was to track down vehicles related to the attack, rather than probing traffic and transport related issues as the journalist had claimed.

He noted that Choy accessed the database to search for vehicle owners and used the information gathered for a television programme, saying this contradicted the claim she made when applying for access.

Lee added that he did not rule out the possibility that Choy had good intentions when accessing the database, but this would not be a valid defence for her actions.

Speaking to reporters outside the court, Choy said she was disappointed with the judgement.

I believe people working in the media sector are also disappointed with the judgement. The rejected appeal would directly affect the search system being used in the sector. This would hinder journalists from monitoring those with power, she said.

Choy added that she would discuss with her legal team whether to appeal again.

In Hong Kong, for example, it affects people in partitioned flats who don't have air conditioning, or people who work outdoors.

The Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions interviewed over 11,000 employees in different sectors between August and October, and found that only about 30 percent of those polled had a pay rise in the previous year. 

The union said this was mainly due to the Covid 19 situation in the SAR. 

The union's chairman, Lam Chun sing, said many workers want a pay rise of 4 to 6 percent next year, as economic activities have gradually resumed in Hong Kong.

For some of the industries, for example, the catering industry was under difficult times, especially in the fifth wave of pandemic. Now, the social distancing measures are relaxed and also we have dine in services at night, so they may have a higher expectation on salary increase in the next year, Lam said.

He called for a pay rise of at least six percent for employees in the coming year.

Earlier, sources said a government appointed committee had proposed raising the statutory minimum wage by 6.7 percent to HK$40 per hour, which might come into force next May. 

Lam said employees welcomed the decision, but the government should note that the current minimum wage of HK$37.5 per hour was set in 2019.

This means some of the grassroot workers [have not had] a salary increase for more than three years... If the inflation rate increases by a higher level, the government should review the minimum wage level immediately, instead of every two years, he told RTHK.

Chief Executive John Lee had said in his Policy Address that he plans to bring in non locally trained dentists and nurses as part of the administration's efforts to revamp the healthcare system.

And earlier, health secretary Lo Chung mau said the government is actively recruiting non locally trained dentists, noting that there are currently about 50 vacancies in the public dental sector.

Chan attributed the manpower shortage to a series of factors, explaining that one of the reasons is because many government dentists are fast approaching retirement age.

'Secondly, maybe the latest migration wave might also affect the situation now. The Covid pandemic may be also affecting their working hours and productivity.'

Chan noted that the government's proposal is an interim measure that would help alleviate the manpower crisis, but he stressed that boosting private dental services would be the most effective way.

By introducing the non locally trained dentists to provide service within the government sector, that can solve the acute demand within the government sector itself, he said. 

In the short term, the fastest way to solve the problem is to introduce the public private partnership model.

At present, inbound travellers are given an amber code on arrival which bans them from going to regulated premises for three days. On Friday, some spectators were turned away from the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens after displaying an amber code at the venue.

President of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants, Simon Wong, said most tourists wouldn't want to come to Hong Kong with these restrictions. 

'It causes a lot of inconvenience to tourists. When they come to Hong Kong, for the first three days, they are not allowed to go to restaurants or some areas indicated by the government.

Professor David Hui, a government advisor on the pandemic, said he believed it's unlikely that coronavirus figures would rebound significantly.

For the Rugby Sevens, I think they have (the) vaccine pass, so people actually have to receive vaccination, and they have also performed the daily rapid antigen test to prove that they are negative,' he said. 

'So under this sort of controlled conditions, they are allowed to eat at certain designated place. If the rugby sevens does not lead to any rebound, there should be more social events going in the same direction, he said.

Hui reiterated the importance of boosting vaccine take up among the elderly and children, reminding parents that the baby and toddler BioNTech jabs have become available in Hong Kong.

He said as the city's vaccination rate increases, some restrictions imposed on inbound travelers such as the so called 'zero plus three' arrangements could be eased further.

It's the first sevens tournament in Hong Kong after a three year hiatus because of the pandemic.

Most fans who spoke to RTHK said they were excited to attend an international tournament.

I'm very excited, because it means Hong Kong is back on the up, and we get to have more fun now, one said.

She added that it's a bit sad that there are fewer overseas spectators than usual and what makes the event special is that it provides a chance to meet people from around the world.

But organisers said fewer foreigners means more locals can enjoy the event.

Groups of schoolchildren said they had been given free tickets. 

A 16 year old student, Casey, was at the games for the first time. He said he was thankful for the experience.

Things said about Hong Kong in the past three years have been pretty negative, so this is a good chance to make ourselves more positive...for everybody around the world to know more about what's happening in Hong Kong, he told RTHK.

Another student, Sean, said he planned to do a lot of cheering.

It's like a once in a lifetime experience. It's something different, especially after all this Covid stuff, it's good to have events like this.

Spectators are required to use the LeaveHomeSafe app and vaccine pass for entry, and also have to show proof of a negative RAT result.

Meanwhile organisers said some 20,000 people were in the stadium by 5pm, including 6,000 schoolchildren.

The CEO of the Hong Kong Rugby Union, Robbie McRobbie, said according to his knowledge, nine spectators were turned away after displaying an amber code at the venue.

The amber code is given to people on arrival in Hong Kong and means they can't enter designated venues, including stadiums, during their three days of medical surveillance. A South African group had told media representatives that they'd been turned away.

The stadium rules and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department rules about not being able to enter sports premises on an amber code is very clear, McRobbie said.

At the same time, at the rugby union, we are still, broadly speaking, nice people. We are sympathetic. We have taken the details of those people and we will have a conversation with them after the event.";Radio Television Hong Kong

Currently, the Wild Animals Protection Ordinance only outlaws feeding animals at Lion Rock Country Park, Kam Shan Country Park, Shing Mun Country Park and parts of Tai Mo Shan Country Park and Tai Po Kau Nature Reserve.

But concerns about wild boars roaming around urban areas have prompted officials to expand the ban to the whole of Hong Kong.

To effectively control wild pig nuisance, apart from conducting capture and humane dispatch operations to reduce the number of wild pigs at nuisance sites, the government also needs to curb wild pig feeding activities, thereby reducing the incentives that attract wild pigs to linger in urban areas and near residential areas, said the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department.

The CE also cited the return of the Hong Kong Sevens as another key example of the city's return to the international stage. 

'Different events will be happening one after the other. Coupled with the gradual relaxation of social distancing measures under proper risk management, Hong Kong will continue to have more vitality and vibrancy,' Lee said. 

'Hong Kong has unlimited opportunities [in the post Covid era], because the coronavirus did not and cannot change Hong Kong's DNA. Hong Kong has always had numerous advantages.'

The council said it is pushing the idea, noting that New Zealand is planning the same move in a bid to eventually phase out smoking in the country.

'Tobacco products are really harmful to everyone. We really hope the youngsters won't join the smokers,' said COSH chairman, Henry Tong.

But lawmaker Peter Shiu, who represents the wholesale and retail sector, said the idea is extreme and would demonise smokers, adding that adults should have the right to choose whether to smoke or not.

He also rejected a suggestion by COSH for a tax on tobacco to be doubled, saying this would hurt grassroots smokers.

If we are able to pass this challenge of the Rugby Sevens tournament, with 26,000 spectators at the three day event and bars operating until very late... if case numbers don't show a huge increase, I believe Hong Kong can further open up conditionally, Ip said.

Meanwhile, a Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) survey suggests most people in Hong Kong want the government to relax anti epidemic measures.

Almost 70 percent of some 700 people interviewed by phone in September and October said they would like to see Covid rules eased, with 20 percent saying the current measures should remain in place and about five percent hoping for even stricter rules.

The Competition Commission said on Friday that it had been investigating Otto Poon's ATAL Building Services Engineering over a suspected air conditioning works cartel. 

The commission has proposed a HK$150 million fine, which is subject to approval by the Competition Tribunal.

The watchdog said the company and its parent firm, Analogue Holdings, have pledged full assistance with its probe.

The cooperation agreements entered into with several respondents in the case represent significant developments in the commission's investigation into the multi year air conditioning services cartels, said the commission's CEO, Rasul Butt, in a statement. 

Analogue Holdings, meanwhile, said in a stock exchange filing that it will not be named as a party in the suit. 

It said the company's board decided that it was in the interests of the firm and shareholders to sign an agreement with the competition watchdog.

In view of the success of the summit, we plan to host the summit again next year, also to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the HKMA, said Eddie Yue, the authority's chief executive.

The three day event, held mainly at the Four Seasons hotel in Central, was an initiative announced by the Financial Secretary, Paul Chan, in his budget. Its goal was to showcase Hong Kong as an international financial centre, as it started to emerge from the Covid pandemic.

The summit began on Tuesday with a dinner at M+, the SAR's museum of visual culture. The following day there were speeches, panel discussions, and what was described as a fireside chat. It officially officially ended on Thursday with a programme of Conversations with Global Investors, co hosted by the Hong Kong Academy of Finance. 

The Monetary Authority said the summit welcomed over 200 international and regional leaders from around 120 global financial institutions including banks, securities firms, asset managers, sovereign wealth funds, private equity and venture capital firms, hedge funds, and insurers.

Image: Shutterstock The Legislative Council on Thursday passed a motion to introduce a charging scheme for glass beverage containers in Hong Kong. 

The scheme, which will take effect in the second quarter of next year, is aimed at encouraging bottle suppliers to do more to recycle their containers. 

Under the arrangement, glass beverage bottle importers and suppliers are required to pay a HK$0.98 levy for every one liter bottle they distribute in the city. 

The environment and ecology minister, Tse Chin wan, said the scheme is in line with the city's 'polluter pays' principle, and called it a step forward in environmental protection.

He noted that two glass management companies have already been providing waste glass container collection and treatment services across the territory.

Under the new scheme, bottle importers and suppliers are required to register with the Environmental Protection Department at the start of next year. 

Tse said exemptions will be provided for registered firms which have in place a recovery and reuse arrangement for their beverage bottles. However, they will have to pay an application fee of HK$9,250.

Environmental group Green Earth said officials should also do more to encourage consumers to recycle their bottles. 

The government can introduce a deposit and return system, so that when a consumer buys a bottle of wine, you pay a deposit, then the consumer will try to find ways to return the bottle, the group's founder, Edwin Lau, told RTHK.

The Centre for Health Protection and the University of Hong Kong (HKU) made the conclusion as they wrapped up an epidemiology investigation in Sham Shui Po, following the emergence of a spate of melioidosis infections. 

They found that 38 of the 471 environmental specimens collected in Sham Shui Po contained traces of Burkholderia pseudomallei – a bacterium which causes melioidosis – 32 of which were extracted from the soil in service reservoirs. 

Among the 32 positive soil samples from the service reservoirs... four have undergone genome sequencing. It was found that the genes of these four soil samples are very similar to that of the patients of the Sham Shui Po cluster. We believe there may be a connection, Albert Au from the Centre for Health Protection said, noting however that experts have yet to ascertain the cause of the outbreak.

Au said the government is amending legislation to list melioidosis as a statutory notifiable infectious disease, which will require doctors to report both suspected and confirmed cases. 

Speaking at the same press conference, HKU top microbiologist Yuen Kwok yung said global warming may be to blame for an increase in cases. 

We believe it's related to global warming. Under global warming, the amount of the bacterium in the soil will increase. And this kind of bacterium can survive both low and high temperatures. So we have grounds to believe that with the temperature rising globally, the risk of melioidosis infections will be increased, along with the amount of bacterium in the soil, he said. 

Yuen advised Sham Shui Po residents not to use tap water that comes out within the first minute for showering, washing their face or brushing their teeth.

Melioidosis is transmitted through contact with contaminated soil or surface water, though human to human and person to person transmission is rare. 

A total of 34 cases of melioidosis have been reported in Hong Kong so far this year – 20 of them from Sham Shui Po.";Radio Television Hong Kong

File photo: RTHK Leading local banks HSBC, Hang Seng, Standard Chartered and Bank of China (Hong Kong) on Thursday announced higher interest rates after the latest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve.

HSBC announced a second interest rate increase in more than a month and this time by a larger margin. From Friday, the bank's Hong Kong dollar best lending rate will go up by 25 basis points to 5.375 percent. It was raised by 12.5 basis points in late September. 

Meanwhile, the bank will raise its savings rate for its Hong Kong dollar deposits by 25 basis points. It went up by 12.4 basis points, also in late September.

'The one month and three month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (Hibor) have continued to increase by more than 59 and 152 basis points since we raised our HK dollar best lending rate in September. In deciding the level of adjustment today, we have assessed the implications of recent economic reports, affordability for borrowers, and interest to depositors, said Luanne Lim, chief executive of HSBC Hong Kong.

Hang Seng Bank announced similar rate increases. From Friday, its prime lending rate will go up by 25 basis points to 5.375 percent and its savings rate will be raised by 25 basis points.

Higher rates will take effect at Standard Chartered from Monday. Its prime lending rate will go up by 25 basis points to 5.625 percent, and its savings rate will be raised by 12.5 basis points to 0.375 percent.

Also from Monday, the prime lending rate at Bank of China (Hong Kong) will be raised by 25 basis points to 5.375 percent, and its savings rate will go up by 25 basis points to 0.375 percent.

Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday raised its base rate by 75 basis points to 4.25 percent with immediate effect according to a pre set formula, in the wake of the US rate hike by a similar margin.

The HKMA also warned the public about rising borrowing costs here.

Many banks have already raised their saving and lending rates, including the prime rates and the interest rate cap for newly approved mortgage loans. The public should be prepared for the commercial interest rates to rise further, and carefully assess and manage the relevant risks when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions, HKMA chief executive Eddie Yue said in a statement.

He also said it's normal for the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to remain weak as the interest rate differentials between the local currency and the greenback widen.

Financial Secretary Paul Chan said continuous US rate hikes will hit demand for Hong Kong exports.

But he played down concerns about the city's economic growth after advance government estimates showed GDP shrank 4.5 per cent in the July September quarter from a year ago.

The economic situation has been challenging. But if we are able to put Covid 19 under control... if we are able to continue to have travellings between Hong Kong and the rest of the world, that will provide added impetus to our economic growth, said Chan.

The financial secretary also said a recent correction in property prices was expected and that there was no need to ease existing government curbs.

File photo: RTHK The High Court on Thursday rejected an attempt to challenge the government's amendment of the law to empower it to invalidate vaccine exemptions. 

The legal amendment was made last month, just days after Justice Russel Coleman ruled that the Prevention and Control of Disease Regulation, in its original form, did not give the Health Secretary the power to void over 20,000 Covid vaccine exemption certificates issued by seven doctors who were suspected of giving them out without properly examining the patients. 

That case was mounted by local resident, Kwok Cheuk kin, who's known as 'the king of judicial reviews' for the number of legal challenges he made against the authorities. 

Subsequent to the law change, Kwok made a new application for a judicial review, suggesting the legal amendment is unlawful as there's no mechanism for affected patients to appeal their invalidated exemption.

Kwok added that the law should not empower the health chief to void exemptions, as there's no guarantee that future health secretaries have the medical expertise to make the decision. 

This application was also handled by Coleman, who noted in a written judgment on Thursday that doctors who had their certificates invalidated can challenge the decision by way of written representations, and the government has offered clinical assessment for affected patients to determine whether he or she is unsuitable for vaccination.

The judge also said he doesn't think someone must be a doctor to have the power to invalidate exemption certificates, noting the secretary 'can, of course, be properly advised'. 

In his ruling, Coleman also said the government's decision to amend the law instead of appealing against his previous ruling was 'an example of the rule of law in action in Hong Kong'.";Radio Television Hong Kong

'Basically, you can imagine the movement of a tropical cyclone to be geared, or guided by an even larger weather system, and that is what we call a steering current, Leung said.

'Now the steering current is not pushing the tropical cyclone towards Hong Kong, therefore it's moving very slowly, because on its own there's no influence at all, because a tropical cyclone would normally move slowly northwards.'

Secretary for the Civil Service Ingrid Yeung Ho Poi yan called on parents to get their children vaccinated and hopes the bookings will come through on the weekend. Some parents took their children to get the jab at Hong Kong Children's Hospital, including a mother with her four year old son. The mother said her elder daughter received the German made BioNTech shots, but did not suffer side effects. Our family was cautious and rarely went outside because we knew our son was unvaccinated and was at the highest risk. Since he is vaccinated now, we hope we can go outside and dine in at restaurants more frequently, she said. The BioNTech vaccine for toddlers is only available at four centers: Hong Kong Children's Hospital, HKU Children Community Vaccination Centre at Gleneagles Hospital Hong Kong, CUHK Medical Centre and Osman Ramju Sadick Memorial Sports Centre. Based on the 750 bookings made as of Tuesday evening, Yeung said the population of children aged below three is around 104,000, but only nearly 19 percent of the children in this age group have received their first dose of Covid 19 vaccine. But she added that the situation is understandable as parents might not be able to arrange vaccinations during weekdays. Parents might have travel plans for Christmas holidays, even if the time is short for receiving three doses before their departure, I hope that parents would stop their vaccine hesitancy and arrange the first dose vaccination for their children immediately, and let them receive their second dose before their trip if the time allows, she said. Yeung's call came as Hong Kong saw 5,068 cases   4,570 local and 498 imported   and 13 deaths, which included a 31 month old boy. Of the reported cases, 742 came from 522 schools, and 19 classes were suspended for a week. Seven elderly homes and four disabled homes reported 22 infections. Subsidised Primary School Council chairwoman Vu Im fan said schools will still implement strict measures as 35 primary schools will resume full day in person classes next month. While the Education Bureau no longer requires schools to set up plastic barriers during lunch, Vu said schools might still want to use them to lower the risk.

The two are among six names reckoned to have received Beijing's blessing to compete with four seats vacant. The others are Adrian Ho King hong, nephew of former Macau chief executive Edmund Ho Hau wah, of the New People's Party, Shang Hailong, general manager of artificial intelligence software firm SenseTime, Chan Wing kwong of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, and Lee Kwong yu of the Federation of Trade Unions The polls on December 18 are to fill seats vacated after four legislators joined Chief Executive John Lee Ka chiu's administration in July. On yesterday's ninth day of the nomination period, Gary Wong, 39, was the first to submit his application to the Registration and Electoral Office, making his third attempt to become a legislator. He lost in the 2016 election for the Hong Kong Island constituency and in last year's polls for the Election Committee constituency, when he came 42nd and could not join the 40 member group. Showing up with Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Standing Committee member Anthony Wu Ting yuk and former secretary for constitutional and mainland affairs Raymond Tam Chi yuen, Wong said: Success or failure is not determined by just an election or two. He noted he has experience in local affairs and also has a broad horizon on national and international levels, adding that he will promote the SAR's advantages with the mainland and promote Hong Kong to the world. It is understood Wong has gathered 20 nominations, including from medical and health sector legislator David Lam Tzit yuen and Heung Yee Kuk legislative representative Kenneth Lau Ip keung. Wong Kam fai, also vice chairman of Hong Kong Alliance of Technology and Innovation, submitted his nomination accompanied by National People's Congress deputy Herman Hu Shao ming, Legislative Council technology and innovation sector representative Duncan Chiu and his Election Committee counterpart Stephen Wong Yuen shan. Wong remarked that since IT veteran Sun Dong left Legco to become secretary for innovation, technology and industry the council has been in need of technology experts, and so he believes he is a solid candidate. My profession is to make judgments based on data, he said, and I hope to make policies in a scientific way. The Registration and Electoral Office confirmed the returning office had received two applications and noted the nomination period ends on Monday.

The four charged by the Independent Commission Against Corruption were physiotherapist Wong Chi yan, 42, unemployed Mabel Yick, 58, graphic designer Wu Hong ki, 44, and financial dealer Kwok Kin chiu, 29. They each face one count of engaging in illegal conduct to incite another person not to vote, or to cast invalid vote, by activity in public during the election period. They are out on bail pending an appearance in Eastern magistrates' courts Friday to make their pleas. The ICAC said Wong and Yick reposted a call by self exiled former lawmaker Ted Hui Chi fung to their own social media accounts during election which the ordinance defined as being from when nominations started on October 30 to voting day on December 19. Wu reposted on his social media page a call made by self exiled activist Sunny Cheung Kwan yeung on his social media page inciting others not to vote . And Kwok reposted a social media call call by former district councilor Yau Man chun, who resides abroad, inciting others not to vote. Warrants for the arrest of Hui, Cheung and Yau had been issued by magistrates in late 2021. On July 27 this year, two men were charged by the ICAC of the same offense. So Tsun fung, the 22 year old former president of Chinese University's student union, was charged for sharing a post by Hui inciting others not to vote between October 30 and December 15. Construction worker Chan Sing, 55, too was charged for allegedly sharing the same post between October 30 and November 21. Convictions are punishable by a maximum penalty of a three year imprisonment and a fine of HK$200,000.

In a written judgment yesterday, court of appeal vice presidents Susan Kwan Shuk hing, and Carlye Chu Fun ling and appeal judge Thomas Au Hing cheung said the trial is of great general public importance that would impact substantially the development of national security law jurisprudence and sedition offenses. Public perception of fairness in the trial is of vital importance to the administration of justice. The court must adopt a flexible and sensible approach to arrive at a decision that would best suit the public interest, they said. It is clearly in the public interest to grant the application for admission on grounds of public perception as well as the other grounds that have been canvassed.

Action Asia Events announced on its Facebook page on Monday that the government had given it approval to hand out bananas at checkpoints. Runners are not allowed to consume the food within the checkpoints, it said. They are required to eat alone and avoid talking while eating. In response to an inquiry by The Standard, it said the approval of bananas was seen as a turning point, as food had been banned from all trail running events in Hong Kong since the pandemic began. It will be the first event in almost three years with some type of food being allowed, race director Michael Maddess said. Of course we would like to have no restrictions on food, but we have to start somewhere. We are hoping for further relaxations together with a 0+0 policy to drive tourism to Hong Kong. But some people asked how runners can do away with the banana peels, to which Action Asia Events said rubbish bags would be made available outside checkpoints. An expert said runners cannot merely rely on bananas during a trail race. Runners should bring their own food too, said Lee Yuet man, chairman of the Hong Kong Recreation and Sports Professionals General Union. Lee said runners should be careful as trail runs require sufficient training. During the pandemic, it is difficult for people to gain long lasting training on trail runs in Hong Kong, and even some professional runners are not able to complete a race, he said.

Also on Saturday, the museum in West Kowloon Cultural District will celebrate its first anniversary. That marks the end of a free entrance arrangement, so general admissions visitors will be charged HK$120 or HK$60 as a concessionary price. But to view the special exhibition Yayoi Kusama: 1945 to Now, which runs to May 14, they must pay HK$240 for a standard ticket and HK$150 for a concessionary for full access to all galleries. Among the three special works 93 year old Kusama has created for M+ are two yellow pumpkin sculptures covered in black dots that are already been placed in the museum's main hall for free public viewing. Pumpkins are a favorite Kusama subject and dots her best known motif. Another piece the museum commissioned is a large scale installation titled Death of Nerves installed in the light well connecting the ground floor and the basement levels. It features her signature infinity nets and comes with a poem she wrote. Her third creation for M+ is Dots Obsession: Aspiring to Heaven's Love. That is an immersive work in a mirrored studio with large balloons covered in white dots suspended from the ceiling. Spanning from Kusama's earliest work to her most recent output, the show is organized chronologically and thematically to walk visitors through her wide range of works. One of the most influential Asians in the history of contemporary art, Kusama was trained in traditional Japanese painting. She moved to the United States in 1957 and soon established herself in American and European avant garde for her unique and radical artistic language before she returned to Japan in 1973. The exhibition will examine her career in Japan, the United States, Europe and beyond through six themes: Infinity, Accumulation, Radical Connectivity, Biocosmic, Death and Force of Life. Walking into the exhibition, visitors will be greeted by a Kusama self portrait featuring her signature dots and favorite yellow color. Curatorial deputy director Doryun Chong says the exhibition can attract over 100,000 visitors. We have just had two million visitors, he said. I think we clearly have become a Hong Kong museum. So based on that we feel confident that even when the museum starts to charge people will come back. M+ and MTR Corp have also joined hands to bring Kusama's work of the two yellow pumpkins to trains on Tuen Ma Line until December 27. By scanning the QR codes in train compartments passengers can listen to an audio guide delivered by M+ curators introducing selected art work by the Japanese artist.

https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/4/247186/Camp-closures-under-attack;2022-11-10 00:00:00; Camp closures under attack The Standard;" Wallis Wang Legislative Council members blamed the government for not having a timetable for reopening public campsites that have been closed for more than two years due to the pandemic. But Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin wan said the government must adopt a prudent and orderly approach in relaxing anti epidemic measures. In a Legco meeting yesterday, Ben Chan Han pan of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong said it was unreasonable of the government to reopen beaches, barbecue sites and even the Rugby Sevens while keeping campsites shut. He also questioned whether the government chose not to reopen the campsites as they cannot bring economic benefits. He said camping had become a holiday leisure activity for many Hongkongers amid the pandemic. However, due to the closure of government campsites and a limited number of private ones, many people had to go camping in non country park sites or illegal areas. Tse said: We must adopt a prudent and orderly approach in relaxing various anti epidemic measures so as to avert a rebound of the epidemic situation and backtracking along the path to normalcy. The government differentiates people into different risk levels precisely and scientifically for proper control and, on the premise of management, allows the maximum degree of daily activities and participants involved, with a view to striking a balance among risks and economic impetus, he said. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department issued 353 warnings and launched 266 prosecutions against illegal camping activities between 2017 and 2021. However, the warnings already numbered 146 and the prosecutions 182 in the first three quarters this year, Tse said. The government has been enhancing facilities in country parks and allocated HK$500 million in the Budget last year. The AFCD would commission a study this year on setting up glamping facilities in country parks, Tse said. The potential sites include Tai Tong in Yuen Long, Tai Mong Tsai in Sai Kung and Rotary Park in Tai Mo Shan.

Customs earlier received information that a saleswoman of a wedding dress rental shop in Prince Edward was suspected of forcing a customer to procure a wedding dress rental service after she had tried on a wedding dress. Although the customer indicated that she would not purchase the rental service and would only pay for the necessary fitting fee, the saleswoman still made an unauthorized deduction of the rental fee from the customer's credit card. The saleswoman was then arrested by customs on Tuesday for engaging in aggressive commercial practices in the course of selling, in violation of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance. Investigations are ongoing and the saleswoman has been released on bail, according to customs. Customs reminded traders to comply with the requirements of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance and consumers to procure services at reputable shops. Any trader who engages in aggressive commercial practices and causes the consumer to make a transaction commits an offense. And the maximum penalty upon conviction carries a HK$500,000 fine and five years' imprisonment.

The iconic Jumbo Floating Restaurant capsized and sank in the South China Sea on June 19 this year. After that, a shipyard said on Monday (November 7) that it is suing the barge's owners to return handling fees as the owners have not transferred the ownership of the barge to it in accordance with a contract. In a writ filed to the High Court on Monday, King Field Shipyard said Jumbo's parent company Aberdeen Restaurant Enterprises and Tai Pak Sea food Restaurant failed to address the agreement   which was signed on May 19   to transfer the ownership of four barges including Jumbo, to the shipyard, after it paid a HK$5.4 million handling fee. However, as the barge owner, Aberdeen Restaurant Enterprises paid a HK$600,000 deposit to the shipyard on May 20, Jumbo capsized while being towed out of Hong Kong. The shipyard, therefore, demanded the holder salvage the barge and pay compensation of HK$4.8 million. In a statement issued by Aberdeen Restaurant Enterprises today, it denied that there was still a contractual relationship with the shipyard. We have written to the shipyard on July 27 informing that the contract will be automatically terminated, said the enterprise, noting it was not in breach of contract. The enterprise added it would actively respond to the lawsuit and file a claim against it. According to the shipyard, under the original contract, Aberdeen Tai Pak Sea food Restaurant and Aberdeen Restaurant Enterprises were required to deliver the four barges by July 31. Even though being told on June 1 by the restaurant enterprises that Jumbo had capsized, the shipyard claimed it would still be willing to move forward with the contract. The case is now being litigated pending further details. Today's Standard Trademark and Copyright Notice: Copyright 2022, The Standard Newspaper Publishing Ltd., and its related entities.

Lam's remark came after lawmaker Tang Ka piu asked Wednesday if authorities will consider connecting the EKL terminus to Lam Tin Station or Yau Tong Station of the MTR Kwun Tong Line to form a loop linkage system in East Kowloon. Tang also referred to reports that the proposed EKL – adopting the elevated trackless rapid transit system – will only run through areas from Choi Hung to Sau Mau Ping. The rapid transit system is a different system from the heavy rail system run by MTR's trains. In the written reply, Lam said the alignment and station locations of the elevated trackless rapid transit system depend on factors including gradient, space for accommodating the elevated structures, construction methods, etc. 'Owing to the hilly topography with a large level difference from Po Tat to Lam Tin and Yau Tong areas, extending the rapid transit system from Po Tat Estate at the higher level to Lam Tin and Yau Tong areas at the lower level is difficult,' according to Lam. Lam continued if the rapid transit system was to be extended to Lam Tin and Yau Tong areas, it would need to pass by major roads such as Tseung Kwan O Road, the viaducts of Kwun Tong Bypass and Lei Yue Mun Road. The transport chief noted the space for the construction of the elevated corridor and stations is very limited, and the technical feasibility is relatively low. Lam went on to say that the underground heavy rail system will not be a practical option for EKL, as it would take a longer time for citizens to travel between the ground level and the train platforms deep underground. 'We are now exploring an elevated trackless rapid transit system from Po Tat via Sau Mau Ping, Shun On, Shun Lee, and Choi Wan connecting with Choi Hung MTR Station as an alternative,' Lam said. The rapid transit system being explored will operate on an elevated corridor to be completely separated from pedestrian and vehicular traffic. And it will not be affected by heavy traffic at Clear Water Bay Road, New Clear Water Bay Road, and Choi Hung Interchange, Lam pointed out.

Lawmaker Chan Han pan, in a written inquiry, asked Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin wan if authorities have a timeline in place for reopening the city's campsites, given that the social distancing measures for catering premises, beaches, bars, and certain places of entertainment have been recently relaxed. In response, Tse said the government operates under the principles of science based and targeted anti epidemic measures, as well as the proper management of risks and citizen focused facilitation. 'The government differentiates people into different risk levels precisely and scientifically for proper control and, on the premise of management, allow the maximum degree of daily activities and participants involved, with a view to striking a balance among risks and economic impetus,' he said. 'The government emphasizes that we must adopt a prudent and orderly approach in relaxing various anti epidemic measures so as to avert a rebound of the epidemic situation and backtracking along the path to normalcy,' said Tse, adding that authorities will closely monitor the latest development of the epidemic and review its anti epidemic measures. As for private campsites, Tse said authorities will step up inspections to ensure such campsites were operating by the books. Meanwhile, the environment chief noted that the government has earmarked HK$500 million in the 2021 Budget for carrying out various enhancement works on the facilities in some of the country parks   including the Sai Kung Wong Shek Campsite, Lau Shui Heung Campsite, and the Twisk Campsite. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department will also commission a consultancy study within this year on the feasibility of setting up glamping facilities in country parks, with a view to determining the site locations, design, mode of operation, fee level, and operation requirements, said Tse.

Lai, six executives of Next Digital – the parent company of Apply Daily, and the group's three subsidiaries were charged with colluding with foreign forces; and conspiracy to publish, distribute and display seditious publications between April 1, 2019, and June 24 last year. Lai was also charged with two counts of collusion between July 1, 2020, and February 15 last year, for calling on other countries and foreign agents to impose sanctions on China and Hong Kong. Lai and three subsidiaries – Apple Daily Ltd, Apple Daily Printing Ltd, and AD Internet Ltd – will plead not guilty. The trial has been scheduled for December 1 and is expected to last for 30 days before a panel of three designated national security judges. In mid October, the High Court's chief judge allowed Owen's ad hoc admission to represent Lai in the trial. The DoJ then filed an appeal against the decision but saw the appeal dismissed by the court. In the latest written judgment released Wednesday, the High Court explained that 'the forthcoming criminal trial is a high profile case attracting substantial publicity locally and abroad.' 'It involves the resolution of legal issues of great general public importance that would impact substantially on the development of NSL jurisprudence and sedition offenses. Public perception of fairness in the trial is of vital importance to the administration of justice.' The High Court went on to say it must adopt a flexible and sensible approach to arrive at a decision that would best suit the public interest in this application. 'It is clearly in the public interest to grant the application for admission on grounds of public perception as well as the other grounds that have been canvassed,' the judgment read. The court also ordered the Secretary for Justice to pay the legal costs. Previously, the DoJ argued that Owen does not have the experience in issues concerning the application of NSL under local laws, and that there is substantial experience in the local Bar in conducting such challenge. The six senior executives also facing prosecution are; Next Digital's former CEO Cheung Kim hung, Apple Daily's former associate publisher Chan Pui man, former editor in chief Ryan Law Wai kwong, former executive editor in chief Lam Man chung, former English edition editor in chief Fung Wai kong, and former editorial writer Yeung Ching kee. The six earlier said they would plead guilty in the hearing on November 22. Two other defendants in this case – fugitive Andy Li Yu hin and paralegal Chan Tsz wah – had pleaded guilty already. Their case will be mentioned on January 12 next year. Today's Standard Trademark and Copyright Notice: Copyright 2022, The Standard Newspaper Publishing Ltd., and its related entities.

In response to lawmakers' argument about poor governance in universities at the Legislative Council on Wednesday, the education minister said the university's Administrative and Planning Committee, which made the decision to change the emblem, was statutorily established. The government will not interfere with institutions' governance and decision making, she said. The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) reverted to its old emblem last month after the new version existed for only seven days but faced rising public backlash criticizing its failure to conduct a public consultation before the logo change. Lawmaker Tommy Cheung Yu yan, one of the university's council members, questioned the Legislative Council that the public failed to effectively monitor such universities' governance, citing that the university council of CUHK was not informed of the emblem change. Lawmaker Priscilla Leung Mei fun said that public funded universities have been given too much discretion, which led to loopholes for the CUHK management board to disregard the council's opinion. Choi, however, said that various stakeholders in the community hold different opinions about the universities' governance, but it is important to have frank communication to come up with a common way forward in the best interests.

https://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news/section/4/196923/Prices-fly-for-Lunar-New-Year-fair-stalls;2022-11-09 15:55:00; Prices fly for Lunar New Year fair stalls The Standard;" A total of 175 wet goods stalls were let in an auction that started on Wednesday for stalls at the 2023 Victoria Park Lunar New Year Fair. A spokeswoman for the Food & Environmental Hygiene Department said the average bid price for the first 15 auctioned wet goods stalls was about HK$31,500, with the highest bid reaching HK$46,000   six times more than the opening price of HK$5,440. Speaking to reporters this afternoon, the department spokeswoman said there won't be any dry goods stalls and food stalls at the Lunar New Year Fairs across Hong Kong this year in view of the Covid epidemic. She said there will be more space for people to observe social distancing without the dry good and food stalls, thus, lowering the risk of Covid transmission. Crowd control measures will be implemented at the fairs, with the maximum number of visitors allowed inside the Victoria Park Lunar New Year Fair at the same time capped at 32,000, she said. The spokeswoman added that the fairs could be canceled should the city's epidemic situation take a bad turn. Flower vendor Kwok, who secured stall No.1 at the Victoria Park fair with a price of HK$36,000, said his winning bid was already lower than that in previous years, with a price reaching up to around HK$70,000. He believed the ban on dry goods and food stalls would not affect people's willingness to visit the fairs, as people are used to getting flowers for the new year. Meanwhile, Kwok said the epidemic had increased the shipping cost for his flowers from the mainland by about 40 to 50 percent, but he said the increased cost would not be reflected much in the selling price of his flowers. He added that he is confident to profit in this year's fair, which he intended to bid for four other stalls.

The four are physiotherapist Wong Chi yan, 42; unemployed Mabel Yick, 58; graphic designer Wu Hong ki, 44; and financial dealer Kwok Kin chiu, 29. They each face one count of engaging in illegal conduct to incite another person not to vote, or to cast invalid vote, by activity in public during election period between October 30 and December 19, 2021, in violation of the Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Conduct) Ordinance. Wong and Yick allegedly shared a social media post by Hui, where he incited others to cast a blank vote during the election period. Wu allegedly shared another social media post by Sunny Cheung Kwan yang, the former spokesperson of Hong Kong Higher Institutions International Affairs Delegation, where Cheung incited others not to vote in the election. As for Kwok, he allegedly displayed a social media post – originally published by former Sha Tin District Councilor Yau Man chun – to incite others not to vote. The four defendants have been released on bail and will appear in the Eastern Magistrates' Courts on Friday (Nov 11). Hui, Yau, and Cheung have left Hong Kong, and the court has issued arrest warrants for the trio. It is understood that Hui is now in Australia. In August, Hui was reportedly splashed with water and verbally threatened in a Hong Kong style cha chaan teng there.

It is obvious that the pandemic in Hong Kong has become stable during the six week period after the '0+3' format launched,the pro Beijing lawmaker Jeffrey Lam Kin fung said at a conference on Wednesday. More convenient disease prevention measures are of priority currently, such as reducing the times for new arrivals to undergo nucleic acid tests for rapid tests instead, he noted. Lam added that a shorter commuting procedure on the border crossing travels with the mainland is more expected since the largest group of tourists inbound are from China. And it is time for the authority to negotiate with airlines to add more flights to embrace more travelers to Hong Kong to boost the resumption of tourism, he said. Previously, the government announced that from November, travel groups in Hong Kong will be granted permission to enter designated tourist attractions, even though holding an Amber Health Code, and dine in designated catering premises.

Police announced today to arrest of the 48 year old teacher of Hong Chi Pinehill No.2 School on Monday on suspicion of publishing anonymous letters falsely claiming to be a student's parent and reporting that her child was being abused by the school. In October this year, the Education Bureau said it received complaints from parents that revealed long period physical child abuse accidents in the school, including faculty tying up children's hands and suffocating them by putting a towel over their faces, with video clips attached. The involved school, Hong Chi Pinehill No 2 School, released a statement afterward to deny the mistreatment, saying receiving parents' contact to clarify the misconduct toward children by teachers was not true. After several investigations, officers found that the abuse allegations were exaggerated and false. No child abuse was detected as officers investigated around 19,000 hours of the school's camera surveillance footage from June to August this year. The video clips attached to the letters, which claimed to record the children's abuse scene, were found to have been made four to eight years ago. We noticed that the content of the anonymous letters was directed at the school's management board, said the police, we believed the person who wrote the letters was dissatisfied with the school's staff. The arrestee, who has been working as an English teacher in the school for more than 10 years, is now detained with police finding a computer and a printer in her office, which were believed to be used for making the anonymous letters.

The Democratic Party released results on Wednesday of its questionnaire about public attitudes towards Covid 19 and the government's related measures. A total of 75.6 per cent of people disagreed that Hong Kong was experiencing a 'public health emergency' per the government's definition, which refers to a situation with a 'high probability of causing a large number of deaths' or a 'large number of serious disabilities.' Around two percent and 11.4 per cent of respondents indicated 'strongly agree' and 'agree,' respectively. The party surveyed 853 people on the phone via random sampling between October 24 and last Saturday, a press release read. More than 82.6% people disagree the effectiveness of Vaccine Pass. The disagreement is in a landslide. I don't see govt offer any reasonable justification in continuing 599L. Govt should drop 599L immediately. https://t.co/GpN6wqMA9z Respondents were also asked how they felt about the government's anti epidemic rules, including the Vaccine Pass scheme, the group gathering ban, and the mandatory mask rule. The Vaccine Pass scheme, which requires people to be vaccinated to enter restaurants and other businesses, proved the least popular with over 82 per cent believing it was ineffective at stopping the spread of Covid 19. Just 0.7 per cent selected 'strongly agree.' The Democratic Party said the government introduced the Vaccine Pass to 'force' people to get vaccinated against Covid 19. 'But now, most people have already gotten the vaccine, and those who have not have their own [medical] reasons,' the party wrote in a statement, adding the scheme had 'completed its historical mission.' Meanwhile, the questions about the group gathering ban and the mask rule yielded more division. A total of 66 per cent of respondents 'strongly disagreed' or 'disagreed' that the ban on group gatherings – currently capped at 12 people – could help control the emidemic. Around 65 per cent said they agreed with the city's mask wearing rules. Hong Kong currently requires face coverings both indoors and outdoors. Hong Kong maintains many stringent Covid 19 rules that much of the world have long abandoned, with the past three years marked by disruptions to in person schooling, cumbersome rules for inbound travellers and on again, off again business closures. The unpopular hotel quarantine requirement for arrivals was scrapped in September following criticism from business groups and lawmakers. The population believed the city had made significant sacrifices under such rules, the Democratic Party's survey found. Asked whether they agreed Hong Kong was 'paying too much social and economic cost to keep the current public health measures in place,' 76 per cent answered 'strongly agree' or 'agree.' The city's economy contracted for a third consecutive quarter in the period ending in September, government figures released at the end of last month showed. Authorities, however, blamed the 'worsened external environment' and rising interest rates globally. Lo Kin hei, the chairperson of the Democratic Party, said Hongkongers had their doubts about whether the city should continue enforcing its strict anti epidemic rules. 'Hong Kong's relaxation of Covid rules is slower than its main Asian competitors  Hong Kong's status as an international finance centre continues to be eroded, and the aviation, logistics and tourism industries are seeing unprecedented blows,' the statement read. The party called on the government to respond to Hong Kong people's wishes, for example by scrapping the '0+3' requirement that bars new arrivals from visiting restaurants and other businesses in their first three days in the city.

The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Wednesday accused physiotherapist Wong Chi yan, graphic designer Wu Hong ki, financial dealer Kwok Kin chiu and Mabel Yick, unemployed, of 'reposting or displaying on their respective social media pages' posts by pro democracy activists asking people not to vote or cast an invalid ballot, according to a statement. 'Each faces one count of engaging in illegal conduct to incite another person not to vote, or to cast invalid vote, by activity in public during election period, contrary to Section 27A(1) of the Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Conduct) Ordinance (ECICO),' the ICAC said. The four suspects were released on ICAC bail and will appear in court on Friday. They allegedly shared or reposted originally posted by former lawmaker Ted Hui, ex district councillor Yau Man chun or activist Sunny Cheung. The three activists have all left the city and are in self exile, with Hui in Australia, Yau in the UK and Cheung in the US. Hong Kong has issued arrest warrants for the trio. According to previous press releases and news reports, more than a dozen people have been arrested over the activists' posts. They include former district councillors and student leaders. In March, 2021, Beijing passed legislation to ensure 'patriots' govern Hong Kong. The move reduced democratic representation in the legislature, tightened control of elections and introduced a pro Beijing vetting panel to select candidates. The Hong Kong government said the overhaul would ensure the city's stability and prosperity. But the changes also prompted international condemnation, as it makes it near impossible for pro democracy candidates to stand. The poll saw a record low turnout of 30.2 per cent, with all but one of the 90 seats won by pro establishment candidates. It also saw the highest percentage of blank votes cast – at about two per cent of the total – since the Handover in 1997.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/09/national-security-trial-of-17-hong-kong-democrats-over-unofficial-primaries-to-begin-on-jan-30/;2022-11-09 17:00:00+08:00; National security trial of 17 Hong Kong democrats over unofficial primaries to begin on Jan 30; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit The high profile trial of 17 Hong Kong pro democracy figures who have pleaded not guilty in the city's largest national security case is set to commence on January 30, 2023, by which time some of the defendants would have been detained for almost two years. Former lawmakers Helena Wong, 'Long Hair' Leung Kwok hung, Ray Chan, Lam Cheuk ting and 13 other defendants who have denied playing a part in an alleged conspiracy to commit subversion will face a 90 day trial tentatively starting on January 30 next year, High Court judges Andrew Chan, Wilson Chan and Johnny Chan said on Wednesday. The Department of Justice (DoJ) will be represented by Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions (Special Duties) Anthony Chau and Jonathan Man Tak ho, lead prosecutor Andy Lo told the court. Chau has overseen numerous national security cases, including the prosecution of activist Tong Ying kit in the first ever trial under the Beijing imposed security law last July. A pre trial review for the 17 democrats is set to take place on January 17. The hearing may be held in two sessions due to the large number of defendants and legal representatives involved. The three judge panel requested the prosecution to file their opening submission by December 16, as well as a set of admitted facts agreed by both parties by December 30. It was the first time for the court to announce a date for the trial, after the case involving a total of 47 well known politicians and activists was first mentioned in March last year. Many defendants have been held in custody for more than 20 months, with only 13 democrats currently on bail. The alleged conspiracy centred on unofficial legislative primary elections held in July 2020, which aimed to help the pro democracy camp select candidates for an upcoming Legislative Council election. The defendants were said to have intended to abuse their powers as lawmakers to veto budget bills, paralyse government operations and eventually force the chief executive to resign had they secured a majority in the legislature. So far, 30 defendants have pleaded guilty and are awaiting mitigation and sentencing. The three judges have yet to decide whether the democrats will face penalty before or after the trial of the 17 who denied the charge. Judge Andrew Chan on Wednesday said he would 'reward counsels by saving time' in a trial as lengthy as the one facing the democrats. 'I will make counsels' lives very difficult if they are dragging the case on,' he said. Unlike most trials in Hong Kong's common law system, the case will not be tried by a jury after Secretary for Justice Paul Lam in August cited 'involvement of foreign elements' in the case as a reason of departing from a jury trial. He also cited concerns over the 'personal safety of jurors and their family members' and a 'risk of perverting the course of justice if the trial is conducted with a jury.' Ex legislator Lam and activist Owen Chow will stand trial in separate criminal cases next year which will likely clash with the security law trial. The current case is to 'take priority,' said Andrew Chan, who informed the chief magistrate and chief district judge about the timetable conflict. Prominent activist Joshua Wong and former Democratic Party chairman Wu Chi wai, were among the defendants who attended Wednesday's case management hearing even though they belong to the group of democrats who have pleaded guilty. As the democrats in custody were escorted out of the dock by corrections officers, their family and friends and members of the public stood up and waved at them. 'Hang in there,' some court attendees said. In June 2020, Beijing inserted national security legislation directly into Hong Kong's mini constitution – bypassing the local legislature – following a year of pro democracy protests and unrest. It criminalised subversion, secession, collusion with foreign forces and terrorist acts. The move gave police sweeping new powers, alarming democrats, civil society groups and trade partners, as such laws have been used broadly to silence and punish dissidents in China. However, authorities say it has restored stability and peace to the city.

The women – surnamed Chow, 33, Ding, 28, Lui, 25 – appeared in front of Principal Magistrate Peter Law at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts on Wednesday, local media reported. Lui was arrested on Tuesday, while Chow and Ding were apprehended back in September but were granted bail. They all worked as child care providers in the 'babies section' of the Po Leung Kuk centre in Causeway Bay. The prosecution asked to adjourn the case as there were more than 50,000 hours of security camera footage and documents to be reviewed, Ming Pao reported. Law adjourned the case to March 29, while granting all defendants a cash bail of $10,000. They cannot leave Hong Kong and must report to the police once a week. They are also barred from entering the Po Leung Kuk facility and contacting any other employees. The trio stand accused of a total of eight counts of 'ill treatment or neglect by those in charge of [a] child or young person,' involving six children under three years old. The alleged offences happened from August 25 until September 14. An anonymity order was granted to protect the victims' identities. The alleged abuse first came to light during an inspection by the Social Welfare Department in mid September, when officials found a child being repeatedly pushed onto a play mat by an employee. More incidents of mistreatment were discovered when the department reviewed the centre's security camera footage. The defence revealed that Chow and Ding have resigned, according to Ming Pao, while Lui currently works as a clerk at Po Leung Kuk, but will submit her resignation to adhere to her bail conditions. Meanwhile, police on Wednesday said that reports of suspected child abuse at Hong Chi Pinehill No. 2 School, an institution for students with intellectual disabilities, were unsubstantiated. A 48 year old teacher at the school was arrested for making false reports of abuse after sending anonymous letters and videos of alleged abuses to parents, the Education Bureau and the media. Reports of alleged child abuse at the special needs school came to light in early October, with teachers being accused of mistreating students by tying their wrists and covering a child's head with a jacket when they threw a tantrum. The teacher was arrested on Monday on suspicion of accessing a computer with dishonest intent and causing wasteful employment of the police. Laptops, memory sticks, stacks of envelopes and postage stamps were among the evidence collected from her residence and office. Police said the allegations made against the school and certain teaching staff were 'exaggerated and false' after speaking with the parties involved and reviewing school records. The videos that appeared to show physical mistreatment were filmed four to eight years ago, they said, with some filmed secretly by the suspect, who has worked at the school for 10 years. 'The content of the letters targeted the school's management and specific teaching staff. We do not rule out that someone fabricated the anonymous letters accusing staff of abusing children out of dissatisfaction with their working arrangements,' Chief Inspector Mo Siu hei said. Mo said the police strongly condemned acts that abused a mechanism aimed at protecting children for personal motives such as revenge.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/09/chinas-national-security-agency-buys-hk508-million-luxury-villa-in-hong-kong/;2022-11-09 15:42:00+08:00; China's national security agency in Hong Kong buys HK$508 million luxury villa; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit China's national security agency in Hong Kong spent HK$508 million ($65 million) on a luxury villa in an exclusive neighbourhood perched on a hill above the city, registry data has revealed. The purchase last month offers a rare glimpse into an organisation which was set up in the Chinese finance hub more than two years ago but remains opaque and free from public scrutiny. The Office for Safeguarding National Security of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region was listed as the buyer of the largest villa at the Mont Rouge residential project in the Beacon Hill district, according to a Land Registry document. The 666 square metre (7,171 square foot) mansion has five bedrooms, three car parking spaces, a garden, its own lift and is described by its developer as 'a residential jewel that secures panoramic views, low density and luxuriant living'. The sale set a record for the most expensive house sold in the Kowloon district on a per square foot basis, according to local media. Beijing's national security office in Hong Kong was established in July 2020 following huge and sometimes violent democracy protests, alongside the imposition of a sweeping security law which has since ensnared more than 200 people, including many of the city's best known democracy activists. The security law empowered China's mainland security apparatus to operate openly in Hong Kong for the first time where their agents can conduct their own investigations and are not bound by the city's laws. The office requisitioned two hotels on Hong Kong's main island to be its temporary headquarters, while an 11,500 square metre government plot has been earmarked for a permanent base. A Hong Kong government spokesperson said the national security office is funded directly by the central government. Hong Kong has been rated the world's least affordable place to buy property for multiple years by the Demographia International Housing Affordability, outstripping famously pricey cities like Sydney and Vancouver. According to Demographia, it would take 23.2 years for a local resident to buy a home even without spending any of their income. The city's sky high property prices have taken a hit in the last six months, weighed down by Covid curbs, political turmoil, population outflow and dampened mainland China demand. But rising interest rates have made mortgages for the average resident become more expensive, impacting affordability even as the property market slides.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/09/name-hong-kongs-parks-after-chinese-heroes-not-colonial-figures-pro-beijing-lawmaker-proposes/;2022-11-09 12:54:00+08:00; Name Hong Kong's parks after Chinese heroes not colonial figures, pro Beijing lawmaker proposes; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit A Hong Kong lawmaker has suggested renaming public parks and playgrounds bearing colonial references to honour present day and historical Chinese heroes. Junius Ho raised the proposal in a Legislative Council (LegCo) meeting, citing Chinese leader Xi Jinping's previous statements that Chinese people must have 'national self confidence.' 'We must strengthen civic education,' Ho said. 'Why aren't we innovative [in the naming of our public facilities]?' The lawmaker's comments came as legislators discussed the removal of the word 'temporary' from five government run parks in the Central and Western District, among them Brewin Path Temporary Playground and Forbes Street Temporary Playground. Some public facilities bear the word 'temporary' in their names because their 'land grants may not have been long term,' Deputy Director of Leisure and Cultural Services (Leisure Services) Ida Lee said. She added that if the land were to be handed to the government indefinitely, authorities would remove the word 'temporary.' 'Now that we are [talking about] changing the names of parks, logically, I am bringing this suggestion out for authorities to consider,' Ho said. In a paper submitted to LegCo, Ho listed 39 names grouped into four categories – historical national heroes, modern day national heroes, present day outstanding Chinese individuals, and outstanding local athletes. Among them were 12th century Song dynasty military general Yue Fei, Manchurian warlord Zhang Xueliang, martial artist Bruce Lee and medical expert Zhong Nanshan. 'There are tens of thousands of heroes and outstanding individuals in the whole of China,' Ho said. 'I think many of these names carry no controversy.' In the local athletes category, 14 people – including fencer Edgar Cheung, swimmer Siobhan Haughey and retired Paralympics star So Wa Wai – were named. Many of Hong Kong's roads and public facilities play tribute to the city's colonial past, named after British royalty or colonial political figures. Pro establishment figures have suggested erasing such symbols. In 2018, a member of Beijing's top advisory body said Hong Kong should 'undergo decolonisation' starting with changing place and street names. The government told lawmakers in a LegCo meeting after that it was unnecessary to review street names. 'Removing colonial government symbols is not a factor for consideration,' then development secretary Michael Wong said, citing the 'chaos and inconvenience' that may be caused by such changes. In the Tuesday meeting, lawmaker Priscilla Leung echoed Ho's comments that there were many figures in Chinese history worth honouring. 'In Chinese history, many have made major contributions to the nation, to society, to the world,' she said. Undersecretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Raistlin Lau Chun said Ho's 'intentions' were good, but that administratively, they would be difficult to implement. Authorities would only consider them for the naming of large parks or playgrounds, Lau added. Ho said the naming could consider the manner in which the city's typhoons are named, whereby there is a list of names and no need for public consultation.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/09/chinas-billionaires-see-fortunes-fall-amid-covid-19-curbs-and-slowing-economic-growth/;2022-11-09 11:27:00+08:00; China's billionaires see fortunes fall amid Covid 19 curbs and slowing economic growth; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit The wealth of China's billionaires this year dropped by the largest amount in more than two decades, according to an annual ranking, as zero Covid curbs and a property market crisis stall the world's second largest economy. The Hurun China Rich List, released Tuesday, said the total wealth of all individuals with a minimum net worth of 5 billion yuan (US$691 million) dropped by 18 percent to US$3.5 trillion. Only 1,305 people made it onto the list — an 11 percent net decrease compared with last year, and the biggest drop in 24 years. The fortunes of China's ultra rich have been battered by Beijing's harsh zero Covid policy, which has heavily disrupted production and supply chains. They have also taken a hit from stock market routs during a two year crackdown on the tech industry, and suffered from geopolitical volatility caused by events such as the war in Ukraine. The property and healthcare sectors were hit especially hard, according to the list. Property developer Yang Huiyan of Country Garden Holdings lost the most personal wealth at US$15.7 billion this year, while Pony Ma, founder of tech and gaming giant Tencent, lost US$14.6 billion after a sweeping crackdown on the gaming industry last year. China's three richest people stayed the same as last year, with Zhong Shanshan, founder of bottled water company Nongfu Spring, increasing his wealth by 17 percent to US$65 billion. Zhang Yiming, the founder of TikTok parent ByteDance, retained second place but saw his wealth drop by 28 percent to US$35 billion after the company's valuation dropped. Alibaba founder Jack Ma fell from fifth to ninth place after losing 29 percent of his wealth to US$25.7 billion, while Pony Ma slipped from fourth place to fifth. Nearly 300 individuals listed last year were absent from this year's list, most from the property industry, which has faced a spiralling debt crisis after the government imposed borrowing curbs in 2020. The chairman of property giant Evergrande, Xu Jiayin, fell out of the 100 richest to 172nd place as his company sagged under over US$300 billion of debt. The International Monetary Fund has predicted that China's annual GDP growth will only reach 3.2 percent this year.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/09/in-pictures-rare-celestial-event-totally-eclipsed-by-thick-cloud-in-hong-kong/;2022-11-09 08:00:00+08:00; In Pictures: Rare celestial event totally eclipsed by thick cloud in Hong Kong; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit A rare celestial event occurred in the skies above Hong Kong on Tuesday evening, when a total lunar eclipse coincided with the moon passing in front of Uranus and obscuring the planet. However, Hongkongers who lined the Avenue of Stars in Tsim Sha Tsui were unable to see the occurrence because of thick cloud. Despite the stubborn cloud cover, dedicated photographers and astronomy enthusiasts positioned along the promenade hoped for a silver lining. The moon was supposed to have turned 'an uncommon coppery red hue,' according to the Hong Kong Space Museum, which live streamed the event. Lunar eclipses occur when the Earth comes between the sun and the full moon, blocking the sun's rays from reaching the moon. It is sometimes called a 'blood moon' because the moon appears red as it is illuminated by light from Earth's sunrises and sunsets. Derek Chan and Kenny Wong told HKFP they had taken annual leave to try and see the total lunar eclipse. 'It's alright if we don't see the blood moon tonight. We can wait for the next one,' Wong said. 'I heard it won't be until 2,000 year time, though,' Chan added. The next time a total lunar eclipse will be visible from Hong Kong will be on September 8, 2025. However, a total lunar eclipse will not occur with a lunar occultation of Uranus in the skies above Hong Kong until 4862.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/08/17-hong-kong-democrats-set-to-face-90-day-national-security-trial-in-early-2023-over-unofficial-primaries/;2022-11-08 21:01:00+08:00; 17 Hong Kong democrats set to face 90 day national security trial in early 2023 over unofficial primaries; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit Seventeen Hong Kong pro democracy figures who have pleaded not guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit subversion are expected to face a 90 day trial in early 2023, a court has heard. High Court judges Andrew Chan, Wilson Chan and Johnny Chan on Tuesday held a case management hearing for 17 defendants who are among 47 well known politicians and activists prosecuted under the Beijing imposed national security law over unofficial legislative primary elections held in July 2020. The designated national security judges demanded the prosecution file a detailed opening statement or a draft of the admitted facts, which would identify their allegations against individual defendants and the evidence they plan to rely on. The court wanted to know 'the case against each specific defendant,' judge Andrew Chan told lead prosecutor Andy Lo, including the acts, conduct and words uttered by the accused the prosecution deemed as relevant to the charge. 'You have been sitting on this case for ages,' the judge said. The 47 democrats were first brought to court in March last year, and most of them have been detained since after their bail applications were rejected on national security grounds following a four day marathon hearing. At present, only 13 defendants are on bail. The alleged conspiracy revolved around the primary polls, which aimed to help the pro democracy camp select candidates for an upcoming Legislative Council election and secure a majority in the legislature. The defendants were said to have intended, had they secured a majority, to abuse their powers as lawmakers to veto budget bills, paralyse government operations and eventually force the chief executive to resign. So far, 30 defendants have pleaded guilty and are awaiting mitigation and sentencing. It is not yet known whether that will happen before or after the trial of the 17 who denied the charge, which is also yet to be set. The request for more detailed accusations was also raised by the defence on Tuesday, after they said the items listed in a questionnaire prepared by the prosecutors were 'too broad or vague' for the accused to admit. Admitting to the items which contained 'hidden traps' would cause 'confusion or injustice' to his client, said barrister Cheung Yiu leung, who represented former district councillor Clarisse Yeung. While prosecutor Lo told the court that the facts they prepared could be agreed by the defendants, judge Andrew Chan cast doubt on such an anticipation. It would be a 'fantasy' for the prosecutors to think they could seek common ground with the defence with the existing list of facts, he said. 'Whatever endeavour you are going to pursue, the result would be fruitless,' the judge remarked. The democrats who denied the charge are set to stand trial before the three judge panel – rather than a jury –after the Lunar New Year in late January or early February next year. The whole trial was estimated to last for 91 working days, Lo said on Tuesday, with the hope of concluding the case that began more than 20 months ago in June or July next year. Around 55 days would be allocated to the prosecution to prove their case by calling upon 51 witnesses and presenting around 100 video clips – totalling 43 hours long – to show the election forums held and events attended by the accused, Lo said. The defence, on the other hand, would be given 36 days to challenge the allegations, with journalist turned activist Gwyneth Ho planning to call upon an expert witness in legislative and constitutional procedures. The plan came after Executive Council convenor and lawmaker Regina Ip was listed as a prosecution witness, Ho's barrister Trevor Beel told the court. Ip was summoned to testify in a closed door preliminary hearing requested by defendant Gordon Ng back in July, when Principal Magistrate Peter Law ruled that there was sufficient evidence to commit the activist for trial. The judges expressed concerns on Tuesday after Lo said the Department of Justice has yet to decide who would represent them at the trial. The choice of counsel would depend on the trial date, he said. The case was adjourned to Wednesday morning for the prosecutors to seek advice and decide on their representation. They are also expected to inform the court when the requested draft of admitted facts or opening statement could be ready. The court may still not be able to settle on a trial date, however, as judge Andrew Chan said some of the defendants who pleaded guilty have yet to admit to facts prepared by the prosecution. There is a possibility that more democrats will stand trial, he said. Tuesday's hearing was held in the West Kowloon Law Courts Building instead of the High Court in Admiralty, where the courtrooms are not large enough to accommodate dozens of legal representatives, family members and friends of the defendants, journalists and members of the public, including diplomats from various consulates.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/10/31/exclusive-university-of-hong-kong-makes-library-users-register-to-access-some-politically-sensitive-books/;2022-10-31 19:40:00+08:00; Exclusive: University of Hong Kong makes library users register to access some politically sensitive books;" Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit The library at Hong Kong's top university has introduced a new system under which readers must register in advance to gain access to some politically sensitive books or archive materials. A Hong Kong researcher said the new policy, which follows moves by the city's public libraries to remove some titles, might impede study of more 'sensitive' topics. The new system has been installed at the University of Hong Kong's (HKU) Special Collections, a space separated by a glass wall within the Main Library building. The area 'houses a unique collection of Hong Kong materials, rare books, and microforms,' according to HKU's website. The Special Collections section was closed from mid February till April for what the university described last December as being for 'Air Handling Unit and dehumidifier replacement.' The statement last December did not mention any changes to accessibility after the space reopened. On May 18, HKU announced a new booking system for reserving desks in the Special Collections area 'to enhance the user experience.' Patrons were required to register books which they wished to consult at the counter. Anyone who wishes to take a photo with their smartphone of a book must first fill out a form, specifying the details of the book and the number of photos to be taken. Previously, users of the Special Collections section did not have to make bookings in advance or register books they wished to consult. The university told HKFP the new booking arrangements were made 'to effectively protect and preserve the fragile and irreplaceable materials for future generations of scholars.' When HKFP visited the library last month, five politically sensitive books – either written by activists or dealing with the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown – were available only in the Special Collections section. The five titles included the English version of Joshua Wong's Unfree Speech: The Threat to Global Democracy and Why We Must Act, Now; Nathan Law's Freedom: How We Lose It and How We Fight Back; Chin Wan's On the Hong Kong City state; Mark Clifford's Today Hong Kong, Tomorrow the World: What China's Crackdown Reveals About Its Plan to End Freedom Everywhere, and a photobook by the now disbanded Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China. For three other books on the Tiananmen crackdown, including the Factual Account of a Search for the June 4 Victims by the leader of the Tiananmen Mothers Ding Zilin, readers had to request access online. Separately, the city's public libraries removed 29 out of 149 books about the Tiananmen crackdown from their shelves, a total of 263 individual copies, an HKFP investigation found last year. The university did not answer questions on how the library determines what books are to be made accessible only on request. In addition to contemporary political books, the Special Collections also hosts colonial records including government gazettes, and Hansards, with some of the materials digitalised by HKU and made available online to the public. A Hong Kong policy researcher, who requested anonymity, told HKFP the new arrangements may deter some from conducting research on more 'sensitive topics.' 'The library still records who borrowed what, and when, they even collect what copies the researchers made. The perception of being 'monitored' is still there, and it may deter researchers from pursuing certain sensitive topics,' the researcher said. While some books might still be on the shelves, 'researchers may have second thoughts on borrowing them.' The researcher described the new policy as 'disproportionate' since it covers the entire Special Collections, including non sensitive materials. 'It is definitely an unnecessary hindrance to the research community.' Apart from public libraries, some primary and secondary school libraries have removed books on topics ranging from introductions to the city's electoral system, to historical titles about the Cultural Revolution, Ming Pao reported. The Education Bureau in February last year published guidelines requiring schools to ensure that materials do not endanger national security. While HKU, like the seven other publicly funded universities in the city, has launched a compulsory national security course, books that are politically sensitive or censored in mainland China such as The People's Republic of Amnesia: Tiananmen Revisited by Louisa Lim, The Tiananmen Papers by Liang Zhang and a memoir by Ai Wei Wei, are still freely available in the university's main library, The Beijing imposed national security law, enacted in June 2020, criminalises subversion, secession, collusion with foreign forces and terrorist acts, which were broadly defined to include disruption to transport and other infrastructure. The move gave police sweeping new powers, alarming democrats, civil society groups and trade partners, as such laws have been used broadly to silence and punish dissidents in China. However, the authorities say it has restored stability and peace to the city. Clarification 31.10.2022: A previous version of this article refers to the English version of Joshua Wong's Unfree Speech: the threat to global democracy and why we must act, now, being only available at the Special Collections section. The Chinese version of the book is also available at Fung Ping Shan Library.

The government said in a statement on Monday that the new measures were announced 'under the principle of striking a balance between epidemic risks and the need for economic development.'Individuals, and those not in group tours, will still be subject to the usual rules. No timeline was given for the relaxation, but the government said the arrangements will be launched 'this month.' Currently, all inbound travellers to Hong Kong are assigned an amber code in their Vaccine Pass app for the first three days. This means they are not allowed to enter venues operating under the Vaccine Pass scheme, including restaurants, bars, gyms, salons and other businesses. Under the new arrangements, those entering Hong Kong in tour groups operated by 'licensed tourist guides' will be able to enter 'designated tourist attractions' including theme parks, museums and temples with an amber code in their Vaccine Pass. They will also be able to eat in the 'partitioned areas' of 'designated catering premises' that meet the government's requirements. The tour groups' travel agents must pre register trip itineraries with the Travel Industry Council, a group that regulates travel agents in Hong Kong. Authorities said they are also exploring the possibility of reducing the number of Covid 19 tests tour group travellers have to undergo fewer Covid 19 tests upon arrival. At the moment, arrivals must take four PCR tests – including one at the Hong Kong airport – and rapid tests every day for a week. While Hong Kong has dropped many of its strictest travel related Covid 19 measures in recent months, including a requirement for arrivals to quarantine in a hotel, the city still maintains rules that countries around the world have long abandoned. Businesses have expressed concern that the current '0+3' requirement is not enough to drive tourism as travellers cannot eat out and go to many attractions in their first three days. The government said plans to relax rules for travellers coming in with tour groups would move Hong Kong towards resuming normalcy and restarting tourism. 'The relevant arrangements can support the gradual resumption of the inbound travel market in an orderly manner, and provide a more favourable business environment for the travel trade,' authorities said in the statement. According to the government's Covid 19 dashboard, the city has seen 1.95 million cases and 10,475 deaths.

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/10/20/uk/manchester-chinese-consulate-hong-kong-protester-intl-hnk/index.html;2022-10-21 02:35:00; Chinese diplomat says pulling hair of Hong Kong protester was his 'duty'; A Chinese diplomat who was filmed pulling the hair of a Hong Kong pro democracy protester on the grounds of his consulate in Manchester, England, has defended his actions – saying it was his 'duty' to maintain China's dignity. 'Any diplomat' would have done the same, Chinese Consul General Zheng Xiyuan said on Wednesday when asked about video footage that has emerged of a group of men assaulting the protester. The confrontation took place on Sunday, when a group of pro democracy protesters turned up to the consulate with banners featuring satirical images of Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The demonstration coincided with the start of a key week long meeting of the Chinese Communist Party elites in Beijing, at which Xi is widely expected to secure a norm breaking third term as leader. Video footage shows one of the pro democracy protesters – since identified as Bob Chan – being dragged through the gate into the consulate grounds and being beaten by the group of men. It also shows Manchester police entering the consulate grounds to break up the violence. In an interview with Sky News on Wednesday, Zheng defended his actions and those of his staff, claiming the pro democracy protesters had incited the violence with 'rude banners.' 'I didn't beat anybody. I didn't let my people beat anybody. The fact is, the so called protesters beat my people,' Zheng said. However, when the Sky News interviewer asked about an image showing him pulling Chan's hair, Zheng seemed to concede he had been involved, saying: 'Yeah, the man abused my country, my leader. I think it's my duty.' 'To pull his hair?' the interviewer asked – to which Zheng responded, 'Yeah!' He added that he was maintaining the dignity of China and its people, and that 'any diplomat' would have done the same in such a situation. In a letter to Manchester police on Thursday, Zheng insisted the consulate had been 'respectful of the right to protest,' and claimed that the consular grounds had been 'stormed' by protesters. China's Foreign Ministry has been quick to defend Zheng, describing the protesters as 'harassers' who had illegally entered the Chinese consulate, 'endangering the security of Chinese diplomatic premises.' The incident now threatens to further damage UK China relations, which have soured in recent years with disagreements over Hong Kong, a former British colony, a major point of contention. On Tuesday, Britain's foreign secretary summoned China's second most senior diplomat in the UK, Charge D'Affaires Yang Xiaoguang, to demand an explanation and express deep concern at the incident. Manchester police have launched an investigation into the assault, but said on Wednesday that there had been no arrests so far, calling it a 'complex and sensitive inquiry' that will take time. Speaking publicly at a news conference Wednesday, Bob Chan said he now feared for his safety, and that of his family – echoing fears voiced by other members of Britain's Hong Kong diaspora. He claimed he had been trying to stop consular staff from ripping down protest banners when they began to assault him. 'I held onto the gate where I was kicked and punched. I could not hold on for long and was eventually pulled into the grounds of the consulate,' Chan said. 'My hair was pulled and I felt punches and kicks from several men,' he said, adding the assault did not stop until a police officer pulled him back out through the consulate gate. He showed photos of his injuries, saying he had bruises on his head, neck, back and around his eye. 'I fear I may be silenced by the powers that be. I fear for the safety of my family,' he continued. 'I'm shocked because I never thought something like this could happen in the UK.' Britain is home to a large number of Hong Kongers, many of whom left the city after Beijing introduced a sweeping national security law in 2020. Under the law, protesters and activists have been jailed, newsrooms shut, civic society dismantled and formal political opposition effectively wiped out. Hong Kong leaders have repeatedly claimed that the city's freedoms remain intact, and that the law has restored order and stability after massive pro democracy protests in 2019. But the combination of China's tightening grip on the city and its stringent Covid 19 restrictions have prompted an exodus from the city in recent years. In August, Hong Kong logged its biggest population drop since official records began in 1961. As the size of the Hong Kong diaspora has grown, and Beijing has become more assertive on the world stage, the UK China relationship has also deteriorated – with British public sentiment souring as well, experts say. 'The Manchester incident reflected the hardening of UK attitudes toward China since the 2019 protests in Hong Kong and the resultant cooling of UK China relations,' said Chi kwan Mark, a senior lecturer in international history at the University of London, adding that it partly reflected 'the intensified ideological clash between China and the West.' And it has become a bipartisan issue, with members of both Britain's Conservative and Labour parties supporting 'a hard line approach to China,' he said. In remarks to the UK's House of Commons on Tuesday, Conservative lawmaker Alicia Kearns called the incident 'a chilling escalation,' a sentiment echoed by Labour lawmaker Afzal Khan, who said: 'The aggressive, intimidating tactics of the Chinese Communist Party have no place on the streets of my city or my country.' 'The British government   is under pressure to do something concerning China, and to stand up for Hong Kong,' Mark said – though he added that those authorities are now in the difficult position of having to 'strike a balance between confrontation and engagement with China.' © 2022 Cable News Network.

The plunge comes at a time when members of China's ruling Communist Party are meeting for the 20th Party Congress, a major leadership reshuffle that sets the tone for policy for the coming years. In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng

(HSI) Index tumbled as much as 3% in Thursday's morning trade. By early afternoon, it pared losses to 1.1%, on track to hit its lowest close since October 2011, according to Refinitiv. The fall comes just a day after the city's leader, Chief Executive John Lee, promised to invest billions of dollars to bring global talent and businesses back to Hong Kong. The index was mainly dragged down by Chinese technology companies. Alibaba

(BABA)'s Hong Kong listed shares fell nearly 3%. Tencent

(TCEHY) also lost 2.9%. Baidu

(BIDU) sank more than 7%. The heavy decline followed a sharp sell off in Chinese stocks listed on Wall Street overnight. Xi Jinping's speech: yes to zero Covid, no to market reforms? The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index slid 7.1% on Wednesday to close at its lowest level since July 2013. JD.com

(JD) lost 7.7%. Alibaba's New York traded stock dropped 6.6%. US stocks closed lower on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.3%. The S&P 500 was down 0.6%, and the Nasdaq slid 0.9%. Other Asian markets also fell on Thursday. Japan's nikkei 22

(N225)5 dropped 0.9%, while the Japanese yen hit a fresh 32 year low against the dollar. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.8%. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 1.1%. But China's Shanghai Composite Index reversed earlier losses and edged up 0.3%. Analysts are concerned about China's growth outlook after Xi Jinping's opening speech at the 20th party congress. The Chinese leader offered no signs of moving away from the country's rigid zero Covid policy or its tight regulatory stance on various businesses, both of which have hampered growth in the world's second largest economy. Xi is expected to secure an unprecedented third term in power at the week long congress. 'China's National Party Congress failed to drive a positive catalyst, ' said Yeap Jun Rong, a market strategist for IG Group, on Thursday. He added that investors are also concerned that rising Covid cases in Beijing may lead to 'aggressive restriction measures.' China's capital detected 41 Covid cases on Tuesday, the most in four months, according to the city's health commission. The country delayed the released of its third quarter GDP data on Tuesday, which has stoked further worries. 'China's decision to delay the release of key economic readings could suggest the data is so ugly that they don't want it released during the party's congress,' said Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the Americas at Oanda, in a research note on Wednesday.

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/10/19/business/hong-kong-business-investment-covid-reopening-intl-hnk/index.html;2022-10-19 03:18:00; Facing brain drain, Hong Kong plans $3.8 billion 'trawl' for global talent;" Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hong Kong wants international firms to know it means business. The city's leader, Chief Executive John Lee, announced Wednesday that the government would earmark 30 billion Hong Kong dollars ($3.8 billion) for a new fund aimed at bringing more businesses in. The fund will seek to attract companies to set up operations in Hong Kong, as well as invest in their businesses, he said in a wide ranging policy address. The move comes after the city witnessed a massive exodus amid some of the world's strictest pandemic controls, which were recently eased after more than two years. In August, Hong Kong logged its biggest population drop since officials began keeping track of such figures in 1961. Lee addressed the record decline on Wednesday, noting: 'Over the past two years, the local workforce shrank by about 140,000.' 'Apart from actively nurturing and retaining local talents, the government will proactively trawl the world for talents,' the chief executive added. Lee also announced Wednesday the launch of an initiative aimed at attracting more workers, including select high earners and graduates from the world's top 100 universities. Eligible candidates 'will be issued a two year pass for exploring opportunities in Hong Kong,' he said. That should come as welcome relief for businesses in Hong Kong, which had long warned of a brain drain. Before the recent removal of quarantine measures, many workers had expressed frustration over the city's onerous travel restrictions, which at one point required up to 21 days of hotel quarantine. The measures damaged the city's economy, and led many multinational companies and expatriates to shift — or consider moving — elsewhere. Hong Kong is the Asian base for many multinational companies, including top banks and financial firms. The former British colony has traditionally been seen as a friendly international gateway to mainland China. In recent years, its reputation for openness and ease of doing business have fallen, while rival hub Singapore raced ahead. Hong Kong is working to change that perception, by stepping up efforts to rebuild its status as a global business and financial hub. Next month, the city's officials will welcome some of Wall Street's top executives for a long awaited financial summit. Goldman Sachs

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/10/17/uk/manchester-chinese-consulate-protesters-intl-hnk/index.html;2022-10-18 05:00:00; Hong Kong protester allegedly beaten at Chinese consulate in UK; Police in Manchester have launched an investigation after a Hong Kong pro democracy protester was allegedly beaten on the grounds of the Chinese consulate in the English city. A pro democracy group called Hong Kong Indigenous Defence Force had staged a protest outside the consulate in the northern city on Sunday, in opposition to the Chinese Communist Party Congress happening the same day in Beijing. Video of the incident shared widely on social media shows a confrontation breaking out on the sidewalk outside the consulate, with loud shouts heard as people rush towards the gated entrance. The video then appears to show one Hong Kong protester being dragged through the gate into the consulate grounds and beaten by a group of men. The video appears to show local police entering the grounds of the consulate to break up the violence. Hong Kong Indigenous Defence Force alleges that Chinese consular staff were involved in the alleged beating, and that the protester was taken to hospital in stable condition. Greater Manchester Police said Monday they were investigating the incident, in which a man 'suffered several physical injuries.' 'We understand the shock and concern that this incident will have caused not just locally, but for those much further afield who may have connections with our communities here in Greater Manchester,' assistant chief constable Rob Potts said in a statement. 'Shortly before 4 p.m. a small group of men came out of the building and a man was dragged into the Consulate grounds and assaulted. Due to our fears for the safety of the man, officers intervened and removed the victim from the Consulate grounds.' 'The man – aged in his 30s – suffered several physical injuries and remained in hospital overnight for treatment. He is continuing to receive our support for his welfare.' The statemented added that currently 'no arrests have been made' and that the investigation was ongoing. A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Liz Truss described the incident as 'deeply concerning.' On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said he was 'not aware of the situation.' 'Chinese Embassy and consulates in the UK have always abided by the laws of the countries where they are stationed,' he said in a regular news briefing. 'We also hope that the British side, in accordance with the provisions of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, will facilitate the normal performance of the duties of the Chinese Embassy and consulates in the UK.' CNN approached the Chinese Embassy in London for comment but did not receive an immediate response. Video of the scuffle has been shared online by multiple UK lawmakers, who have called for an investigation into the alleged involvement of Chinese consular staff. 'The UK Government must demand a full apology from the Chinese Ambassador to the UK and demand those responsible are sent home to China,' ruling Conservative Party lawmaker Iain Duncan Smith wrote on Twitter. Conservative Party member of Parliament Alicia Kearns also tweeted on Sunday that authorities 'need to urgently investigate,' and that the Chinese Ambassador should be summoned. 'If any official has beaten protesters, they must be expelled or prosecuted,' she wrote. Both lawmakers have previously been vocal critics of the Chinese Communist Party. Prominent Hong Kong activists have also spoken out. Nathan Law, a former lawmaker and pro democracy figure who fled to the UK in 2020, tweeted: 'If the consulate staff responsible are not held accountable, Hong Kongers would live in fear of being kidnapped and persecuted.' He urged the British government to 'investigate and protect our community and people in the UK.' Britain is home to large numbers of Hong Kong citizens, many of whom left the territory following the introduction of a sweeping national security law in 2020 that critics say stripped the former British colony of its autonomy and precious civil freedoms, while cementing Beijing's authoritarian rule. According to an online statement by organizers of Sunday's protest, around 60 demonstrators had gathered outside the Manchester consulate to protest 'the re election of Xi Jinping.' The Chinese Communist Party Congress, a twice a decade leadership reshuffle and meeting of the party's top officials, kicked off on Sunday. Chinese leader Xi, who came to power in 2012, is widely expected to break with convention and take on a third term, paving the way for lifelong rule. © 2022 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.
