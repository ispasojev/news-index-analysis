Photo: RTHK A green group on Wednesday called on government departments to set their own carbon emission targets and lay out a more comprehensive roadmap to carbon neutrality.

In its latest study, Greenpeace spoke to 74 departments in September about their carbon emission efforts, and examined Environmental Performance Reports released in 2021 by 44 of them.

While the government's target is for Hong Kong to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050, the study found that none of its departments had set quantifiable emission targets or a timetable for carbon neutrality.

'Actually there are so many measures they can do. I would say that after how many years of promoting carbon neutrality, they know how to do it, said Greenpeace campaigner Tom Ng.

'They know what kind of measures are needed, but they also need to show the public what are their goals, and when are they going to achieve those goals.'

Ng also called some carbon reduction policies covered in the government reports 'out of date', saying some of them have been in place for almost a decade.

He said that for example in one of the latest reports, using lead free petrol was mentioned as an environmental initiative, despite leaded petrol being banned since 1999. 

Ng urged the government to roll out up to date environmental policies to realise its carbon neutral goal by 2050.

File photo: AFP An appellate court on Wednesday upheld a decision to allow a veteran British lawyer to defend media tycoon Jimmy Lai in his upcoming national security trial. 

Lai, 74, had earlier been granted permission by High Court Judge Jeremy Poon to engage King's Counsel, Timothy Owen, in the trial that is scheduled to begin on December 1. 

The Secretary for Justice subsequently appealed against the admission of Owen, arguing that his involvement will not add any significant dimension to the trial. 

The government had argued that Owen did not have the expertise or experience in issues concerning the offences that Lai was charged with under the national security law – which it said was tailored to Hong Kong's unique constitutional framework. 

As for another charge of printing and distributing seditious publications brought against Lai under the Crimes Ordinance, the government said there is already 'substantial experience' among local barristers to handle it. 

But a three judge panel rejected the government's grounds. 

In a written judgment, the panel said the decision to admit Owen had balanced different aspects, including the novelty and the great general public importance of the legal issues involved, the unusual difficulty and complexity of the case, and its substantial impact on the development of Hong Kong law. 

The appellant court said 'the unique context of the national security law' should not take precedence over other aspects of public interest when it comes to the admission of overseas counsels. 

The judges added that the public's perception of fairness in the trial is of vital importance to the administration of justice, adding that Owen should be admitted on grounds of public perception as well. 

Lai, the founder of the now defunct Apple Daily newspaper, will face trial for allegedly taking part in a conspiracy to print, publish, sell, offer for sale, distribute, display and/or reproduce seditious publications, as well as conspiring with others to collude with a foreign country or external elements to endanger national security.";Radio Television Hong Kong

Police said they've arrested a teacher at a special needs school in Tai Po on Monday for allegedly falsely accusing her colleagues of abusing students. 

The force said the 48 year old teacher of Hong Chi Pinehill No.2 School is suspected to have sent anonymous letters to parents, the school's managing body as well as the Education Bureau, falsely claiming that a number of teachers had abused students.

Chief Inspector Mo Siu hei said upon receiving reports in August, officers conducted a thorough probe into the matter and found the allegations to be exaggerated and false. 

Mo added that some of the video clips that came with the letters were recorded four to eight years ago. 

'After investigating [the case], it was found that some of the accused staff in the clip was not present at the time,' he said.

CUHK last month reverted back to the old emblem after a public backlash, with some lawmakers arguing that the saga was a case of poor governance. 

Responding to a question in the Legislative Council, Choi said the university formed a committee on the emblem in accordance with the law, adding that the government doesn't interfere in CUHK's internal decisions because of institutional autonomy.

So it's not the case that the committee made its own decisions. It had to report to the governing council via the vice chancellor, she told lawmakers, adding that people can take such matters to court if they suspect a breach of regulations.

Business and Professionals Alliance lawmaker Priscilla Leung accused Choi of dancing around the issue, alleging that the governing council had failed in its supervisory role regarding the emblem change.

Leung claimed that a low percentage of outsiders on CUHK's council has caused poor governance, citing government figures as saying that outsiders make up more than half of the members of several university councils in Hong Kong, but just 17 percent at CUHK.

Choi, however, stressed that the composition of the university councils is related to the different history and development of the institutions.

The minister said it's normal for stakeholders to have different views about university governance, but they should have frank exchanges with the university for the overall interests of all sides. 

Leung, who said she was not happy with Choi's answers, also complained that three lawmakers who are CUHK council members do not have the power to ensure an item is discussed by the governing body.

The existing [CUHK] ordinance has given too much discretion for a publicly funded university, and I believe it has provided a lot of loopholes for the CUHK management to disregard the opinion of the council, she told reporters.

The lawmaker said she plans to invite CUHK management to a Legco panel meeting next month to discuss the institution's governance.";Radio Television Hong Kong

Image: Shutterstock An anti tobacco advocate on Wednesday hailed the work of Hong Kong in bringing down the city's smoking rate over the past 40 years, but said more needs to be done to further deter people from lighting up. 

Dr Judith Mackay, director of the Asian Consultancy on Tobacco Control, told RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme that the city had performed remarkably well, passing a slew of legislation and raising the tobacco tax. 

But Mackay said the government needs to bring in further measures as there are still hundreds of thousands of smokers in the territory. 

She threw her support behind a proposal by the government to continuously raise the city's legal smoking age, saying studies show the average age to take up the habit is under 20, when youngsters' brains are still not fully developed. 

So if we can prevent people from starting smoking until they're 23 or 24, then they're most unlikely to start, Mackay said.

The expert added that raising the tobacco tax is also crucial in discouraging youngsters to smoke. 

They just simply can't afford expensive cigarettes. It's as simple as that. So it's not health education in schools, it's actually a fiscal measure that really helps them stop. And we haven't had a tax increase, inexplicably, we haven't had a tax increase since 2014, Mackay said.

On an RTHK programme, Yeung noted that children as young as six months can now receive a diluted version of the BioNTech vaccine, as an alternative to the Sinovac jab that was already available.

As at 7pm on Tuesday, 750 bookings were made for the toddler formula of the BioNTech vaccine. She said the number of bookings for child jabs has not been satisfactory.

'The vaccination rate for children aged below three is lower than 19 percent. It is very worrying. In particular for parents who plan to take their children on holiday during Christmas or the Lunar New Year, they should really have their kids vaccinated,' she said, adding that the government does not have a target as to how many young children it wants to see inoculated against the coronavirus.

The minister said while there's no walk in arrangement for the BioNTech toddler jabs, she believes parents can easily make a booking for the same day as there are still many free slots at the moment. 

On the same programme, the chairwoman of the Subsidised Primary School Council, Vu Im fan, said primary schools are making preparations to resume full day classes.

At a workshop for Legal Week, Lam noted that Xi made the promise in a speech on July 1 duringcelebrations for the 25th anniversary of the SAR's establishment. 

Lam said despite being the only common law jurisdiction in China, Hong Kong has managed to develop mutual legal assistance agreements with the mainland – including a 'reciprocal and enforcement of judgements' arrangement. 

'[It] provides a straightforward registration mechanism for the enforcement of mainland judgements in Hong Kong with sufficient safeguards reflecting the existing common law principles and also international standards,' he said. 

'It will better protect parties' interests and enhance the certainty and predictability of cross border enforceability of the relevant applicable judgements,' he said. 

'It will in turn improve the environment for cross border trade and investment and enhance our competitiveness as a regional legal and dispute resolution service centre.' 

Speaking at the same event, the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong, Liu Guangyuan, said the SAR has achieved great development with the support of the motherland and the implementation of One Country, Two Systems in the past decade. 

Liu said that as Hong Kong went through 'turbulent development' during the social unrest of 2019, the central government exercised overall jurisdiction over the city, put into effect the national security law in the SAR, and implemented the policy of patriots administering Hong Kong. 

With these efforts, Hong Kong opened a new chapter of good governance, Liu said.

Gianna Hsu's comment came a day after the government said it would allow inbound tour groups to visit attractions such as theme parks, museums and temples as soon as they arrive in the city.

Speaking on an RTHK programme, Hsu said while the move sends a positive message to the world, it's not likely to have a significant and immediate impact on the tourism trade. 

We don't expect that the easing of amber code restrictions for tour groups will immediately attract many inbound tourists, especially during the beginning. After all, we still have some Covid restrictions in place. But it is a start, she said, adding that she believes the new measure will bring in some visitors from Southeast Asia.

She said her council will work with the government to finalise the list of attractions to be covered under the new arrangement, which she said will include theme parks and the M+ museum. 

Under the new arrangement for inbound tour groups, the government also said travellers will be allowed to have their meals inside partitioned areas within designated restaurants. 

The chairman of the Association for Hong Kong Catering Services Management, Leung Chun wah, told RTHK he expects large Chinese restaurants to benefit the most under the new rules.

The administration welcomed the recommendation from the Advisory Panel on Covid 19 Vaccines and said Secretary for Health Lo Chung mau would come to a decision as soon as possible on the use of the updated BioNTech vaccine. 

Panel members considering the application from distributor Fosun Pharma said they believed that the benefits of authorising the updated vaccine for emergency use outweigh the risks.

They've suggested adding conditions to the approval, including requiring the drug manufacturer to continue providing the latest clinical data, safety update reports, and quality certification documents for each batch of vaccines.

Other government advisers had earlier recommended that the updated vaccine, known as a bivalent jab, would be suitable as an alternative for booster doses for people aged 12 and above.

The jab targets the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 variants, but experts say it may trigger broader immunity against different strains compared to the original version.

His comments came after certain rules were waived for last week's Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit and the Hong Kong Sevens.

'For activities, particularly large scale [ones] with economic elements, and also international events, we will, while controlling the risk, allow them to happen with specific plans,' Lee said ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting. 

The government announced on Monday that inbound tour groups will soon be allowed to visit attractions and eat at designated restaurants as soon as they arrive in the SAR, despite the three day amber health code for arrivals which usually bans such activities.

Lee was asked when individuals coming to the territory will also be able to eat out and enter various venues in their first few days here.

'As we go through more and more activities, we can of course review the experience, and then look at the data, so that we can have more measures designed, so as to allow activities to proceed with the maximum of freedom,' he said.

But the CE said some Covid measures must remain in place as safeguards: 'Masks will stay on, because I think all experts have indicated that masks are important to control the spread of the disease.'

Officials are also considering reducing the amount of Covid tests people on short trips to the city have to undergo.

In a statement on Monday, the government said inbound tour groups accompanied by licensed guides will be permitted to go to attractions such as theme parks, museums and temples as soon as they arrive in the city. 

They will also be allowed into designated restaurants, but will have to dine in partitioned areas.

The amber code that arrivals are given for their first three days in Hong Kong bars them from going to restaurants and other places where people have their vaccination records scanned. 

The government said easing the rules for those on tours can support the gradual resumption of the inbound travel market in an orderly manner, and provide a more favourable business environment for the travel trade. 

It added that it will hold discussions with the Travel Industry Council (TIC) on which attractions should be covered under the new arrangement, which will begin some time this month.

The statement also said the government is exploring whether it is permissible to allow inbound tour groups to take fewer Covid tests during their stay, while balancing the epidemic risks.

Both the tourism sector and catering businesses welcomed the news. 

At a press conference held soon after the government's announcement, lawmaker Tommy Cheung who represents the catering sector said restaurants are ready to start discussing the details with the authorities on how to accommodate tour groups. 

The TIC's executive director, Fanny Yeung, said the move sends a message to the rest of the world that Hong Kong is back to normal. 

'We won't expect a lot of tourists in the beginning of this relaxation. But I think this is a very important positive sign to the world that Hong Kong is back,' she said. 

'So, our tourists, next time  not only the tourists, but even our overseas trade partners, when they plan for the next trip, put Hong Kong as their priority destination.'

Yeung said the council has proposed a list of attractions, including the M+ Museum and the Big Buddha statue, to be included in the new arrangements.

Meanwhile, the Tourism Board (HKTB) also welcomed the government's announcement, saying it expects the measure to gradually bring in more tourists.

'The new arrangements mark Hong Kong's resumption to normality and send a positive message to travellers and our trade partners around the world. It is expected that the specific arrangements can help gradually attract leisure travellers to visit Hong Kong again, especially consumers in short haul markets,' HKTB chairman Pang Yiu kai said. 

'The HKTB will continue to work with the Government, the tourism industry, and related sectors to demonstrate Hong Kong's diverse tourism appeal to ramp up travellers' interests in visiting the city, so as to drive the revival of tourism in Hong Kong.'

Photo: RTHK The High Court on Monday rejected an appeal by former RTHK freelance producer Bao Choy against her conviction for making false statements when accessing a government vehicle registration database.

Choy was fined HK$6,000 last year for the breach, which took place as she investigated the 2019 Yuen Long gang attack. 

Handing down his verdict, judge Alex Lee said Choy's intention was to track down vehicles related to the attack, rather than probing traffic and transport related issues as the journalist had claimed.

He noted that Choy accessed the database to search for vehicle owners and used the information gathered for a television programme, saying this contradicted the claim she made when applying for access.

Lee added that he did not rule out the possibility that Choy had good intentions when accessing the database, but this would not be a valid defence for her actions.

Speaking to reporters outside the court, Choy said she was disappointed with the judgement.

I believe people working in the media sector are also disappointed with the judgement. The rejected appeal would directly affect the search system being used in the sector. This would hinder journalists from monitoring those with power, she said.

Choy added that she would discuss with her legal team whether to appeal again.

The Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions interviewed over 11,000 employees in different sectors between August and October, and found that only about 30 percent of those polled had a pay rise in the previous year. 

The union said this was mainly due to the Covid 19 situation in the SAR. 

The union's chairman, Lam Chun sing, said many workers want a pay rise of 4 to 6 percent next year, as economic activities have gradually resumed in Hong Kong.

For some of the industries, for example, the catering industry was under difficult times, especially in the fifth wave of pandemic. Now, the social distancing measures are relaxed and also we have dine in services at night, so they may have a higher expectation on salary increase in the next year, Lam said.

He called for a pay rise of at least six percent for employees in the coming year.

Earlier, sources said a government appointed committee had proposed raising the statutory minimum wage by 6.7 percent to HK$40 per hour, which might come into force next May. 

Lam said employees welcomed the decision, but the government should note that the current minimum wage of HK$37.5 per hour was set in 2019.

Chief Executive John Lee had said in his Policy Address that he plans to bring in non locally trained dentists and nurses as part of the administration's efforts to revamp the healthcare system.

And earlier, health secretary Lo Chung mau said the government is actively recruiting non locally trained dentists, noting that there are currently about 50 vacancies in the public dental sector.

Chan attributed the manpower shortage to a series of factors, explaining that one of the reasons is because many government dentists are fast approaching retirement age.

'Secondly, maybe the latest migration wave might also affect the situation now. The Covid pandemic may be also affecting their working hours and productivity.'

Chan noted that the government's proposal is an interim measure that would help alleviate the manpower crisis, but he stressed that boosting private dental services would be the most effective way.

By introducing the non locally trained dentists to provide service within the government sector, that can solve the acute demand within the government sector itself, he said. 

In the short term, the fastest way to solve the problem is to introduce the public private partnership model.

At present, inbound travellers are given an amber code on arrival which bans them from going to regulated premises for three days. On Friday, some spectators were turned away from the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens after displaying an amber code at the venue.

President of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants, Simon Wong, said most tourists wouldn't want to come to Hong Kong with these restrictions. 

'It causes a lot of inconvenience to tourists. When they come to Hong Kong, for the first three days, they are not allowed to go to restaurants or some areas indicated by the government.

Professor David Hui, a government advisor on the pandemic, said he believed it's unlikely that coronavirus figures would rebound significantly.

For the Rugby Sevens, I think they have (the) vaccine pass, so people actually have to receive vaccination, and they have also performed the daily rapid antigen test to prove that they are negative,' he said.

It's the first sevens tournament in Hong Kong after a three year hiatus because of the pandemic.

Most fans who spoke to RTHK said they were excited to attend an international tournament.

I'm very excited, because it means Hong Kong is back on the up, and we get to have more fun now, one said.

She added that it's a bit sad that there are fewer overseas spectators than usual and what makes the event special is that it provides a chance to meet people from around the world.

But organisers said fewer foreigners means more locals can enjoy the event.

Groups of schoolchildren said they had been given free tickets. 

A 16 year old student, Casey, was at the games for the first time. He said he was thankful for the experience.

Things said about Hong Kong in the past three years have been pretty negative, so this is a good chance to make ourselves more positive...for everybody around the world to know more about what's happening in Hong Kong, he told RTHK.

Another student, Sean, said he planned to do a lot of cheering.

It's like a once in a lifetime experience. It's something different, especially after all this Covid stuff, it's good to have events like this.

Spectators are required to use the LeaveHomeSafe app and vaccine pass for entry, and also have to show proof of a negative RAT result.

Meanwhile organisers said some 20,000 people were in the stadium by 5pm, including 6,000 schoolchildren.

The CEO of the Hong Kong Rugby Union, Robbie McRobbie, said according to his knowledge, nine spectators were turned away after displaying an amber code at the venue.

The amber code is given to people on arrival in Hong Kong and means they can't enter designated venues, including stadiums, during their three days of medical surveillance. A South African group had told media representatives that they'd been turned away.

The stadium rules and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department rules about not being able to enter sports premises on an amber code is very clear, McRobbie said.

Currently, the Wild Animals Protection Ordinance only outlaws feeding animals at Lion Rock Country Park, Kam Shan Country Park, Shing Mun Country Park and parts of Tai Mo Shan Country Park and Tai Po Kau Nature Reserve.

But concerns about wild boars roaming around urban areas have prompted officials to expand the ban to the whole of Hong Kong.

To effectively control wild pig nuisance, apart from conducting capture and humane dispatch operations to reduce the number of wild pigs at nuisance sites, the government also needs to curb wild pig feeding activities, thereby reducing the incentives that attract wild pigs to linger in urban areas and near residential areas, said the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department.

'Tobacco products are really harmful to everyone. We really hope the youngsters won't join the smokers,' said COSH chairman, Henry Tong.

In view of the success of the summit, we plan to host the summit again next year, also to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the HKMA, said Eddie Yue, the authority's chief executive.

The three day event, held mainly at the Four Seasons hotel in Central, was an initiative announced by the Financial Secretary, Paul Chan, in his budget. Its goal was to showcase Hong Kong as an international financial centre, as it started to emerge from the Covid pandemic.

The summit began on Tuesday with a dinner at M+, the SAR's museum of visual culture. The following day there were speeches, panel discussions, and what was described as a fireside chat. It officially officially ended on Thursday with a programme of Conversations with Global Investors, co hosted by the Hong Kong Academy of Finance. 

The Monetary Authority said the summit welcomed over 200 international and regional leaders from around 120 global financial institutions including banks, securities firms, asset managers, sovereign wealth funds, private equity and venture capital firms, hedge funds, and insurers.

Image: Shutterstock The Legislative Council on Thursday passed a motion to introduce a charging scheme for glass beverage containers in Hong Kong. 

The scheme, which will take effect in the second quarter of next year, is aimed at encouraging bottle suppliers to do more to recycle their containers. 

Under the arrangement, glass beverage bottle importers and suppliers are required to pay a HK$0.98 levy for every one liter bottle they distribute in the city. 

The environment and ecology minister, Tse Chin wan, said the scheme is in line with the city's 'polluter pays' principle, and called it a step forward in environmental protection.

He noted that two glass management companies have already been providing waste glass container collection and treatment services across the territory.

Under the new scheme, bottle importers and suppliers are required to register with the Environmental Protection Department at the start of next year. 

Tse said exemptions will be provided for registered firms which have in place a recovery and reuse arrangement for their beverage bottles. However, they will have to pay an application fee of HK$9,250.

Environmental group Green Earth said officials should also do more to encourage consumers to recycle their bottles. 

The government can introduce a deposit and return system, so that when a consumer buys a bottle of wine, you pay a deposit, then the consumer will try to find ways to return the bottle, the group's founder, Edwin Lau, told RTHK.

The Centre for Health Protection and the University of Hong Kong (HKU) made the conclusion as they wrapped up an epidemiology investigation in Sham Shui Po, following the emergence of a spate of melioidosis infections. 

They found that 38 of the 471 environmental specimens collected in Sham Shui Po contained traces of Burkholderia pseudomallei – a bacterium which causes melioidosis – 32 of which were extracted from the soil in service reservoirs. 

Among the 32 positive soil samples from the service reservoirs... four have undergone genome sequencing. It was found that the genes of these four soil samples are very similar to that of the patients of the Sham Shui Po cluster. We believe there may be a connection, Albert Au from the Centre for Health Protection said, noting however that experts have yet to ascertain the cause of the outbreak.

Au said the government is amending legislation to list melioidosis as a statutory notifiable infectious disease, which will require doctors to report both suspected and confirmed cases. 

Speaking at the same press conference, HKU top microbiologist Yuen Kwok yung said global warming may be to blame for an increase in cases. 

We believe it's related to global warming. Under global warming, the amount of the bacterium in the soil will increase. And this kind of bacterium can survive both low and high temperatures. So we have grounds to believe that with the temperature rising globally, the risk of melioidosis infections will be increased, along with the amount of bacterium in the soil, he said. 

Yuen advised Sham Shui Po residents not to use tap water that comes out within the first minute for showering, washing their face or brushing their teeth.

Melioidosis is transmitted through contact with contaminated soil or surface water, though human to human and person to person transmission is rare.

File photo: RTHK Leading local banks HSBC, Hang Seng, Standard Chartered and Bank of China (Hong Kong) on Thursday announced higher interest rates after the latest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve.

HSBC announced a second interest rate increase in more than a month and this time by a larger margin. From Friday, the bank's Hong Kong dollar best lending rate will go up by 25 basis points to 5.375 percent. It was raised by 12.5 basis points in late September. 

Meanwhile, the bank will raise its savings rate for its Hong Kong dollar deposits by 25 basis points. It went up by 12.4 basis points, also in late September.

'The one month and three month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (Hibor) have continued to increase by more than 59 and 152 basis points since we raised our HK dollar best lending rate in September. In deciding the level of adjustment today, we have assessed the implications of recent economic reports, affordability for borrowers, and interest to depositors, said Luanne Lim, chief executive of HSBC Hong Kong.

Hang Seng Bank announced similar rate increases. From Friday, its prime lending rate will go up by 25 basis points to 5.375 percent and its savings rate will be raised by 25 basis points.

Higher rates will take effect at Standard Chartered from Monday. Its prime lending rate will go up by 25 basis points to 5.625 percent, and its savings rate will be raised by 12.5 basis points to 0.375 percent.

Also from Monday, the prime lending rate at Bank of China (Hong Kong) will be raised by 25 basis points to 5.375 percent, and its savings rate will go up by 25 basis points to 0.375 percent.

Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday raised its base rate by 75 basis points to 4.25 percent with immediate effect according to a pre set formula, in the wake of the US rate hike by a similar margin.

The HKMA also warned the public about rising borrowing costs here.

Many banks have already raised their saving and lending rates, including the prime rates and the interest rate cap for newly approved mortgage loans. The public should be prepared for the commercial interest rates to rise further, and carefully assess and manage the relevant risks when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions, HKMA chief executive Eddie Yue said in a statement.

He also said it's normal for the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to remain weak as the interest rate differentials between the local currency and the greenback widen.

Financial Secretary Paul Chan said continuous US rate hikes will hit demand for Hong Kong exports.

But he played down concerns about the city's economic growth after advance government estimates showed GDP shrank 4.5 per cent in the July September quarter from a year ago.

The economic situation has been challenging. But if we are able to put Covid 19 under control... if we are able to continue to have travellings between Hong Kong and the rest of the world, that will provide added impetus to our economic growth, said Chan.

The financial secretary also said a recent correction in property prices was expected and that there was no need to ease existing government curbs.

File photo: RTHK The High Court on Thursday rejected an attempt to challenge the government's amendment of the law to empower it to invalidate vaccine exemptions. 

The legal amendment was made last month, just days after Justice Russel Coleman ruled that the Prevention and Control of Disease Regulation, in its original form, did not give the Health Secretary the power to void over 20,000 Covid vaccine exemption certificates issued by seven doctors who were suspected of giving them out without properly examining the patients. 

That case was mounted by local resident, Kwok Cheuk kin, who's known as 'the king of judicial reviews' for the number of legal challenges he made against the authorities. 

Subsequent to the law change, Kwok made a new application for a judicial review, suggesting the legal amendment is unlawful as there's no mechanism for affected patients to appeal their invalidated exemption.

Kwok added that the law should not empower the health chief to void exemptions, as there's no guarantee that future health secretaries have the medical expertise to make the decision. 

This application was also handled by Coleman, who noted in a written judgment on Thursday that doctors who had their certificates invalidated can challenge the decision by way of written representations, and the government has offered clinical assessment for affected patients to determine whether he or she is unsuitable for vaccination.

The judge also said he doesn't think someone must be a doctor to have the power to invalidate exemption certificates, noting the secretary 'can, of course, be properly advised'. 

In his ruling, Coleman also said the government's decision to amend the law instead of appealing against his previous ruling was 'an example of the rule of law in action in Hong Kong'.";Radio Television Hong Kong

Image courtesy of the Hong Kong Observatory The Observatory has said it will downgrade the T8 signal at or before 5.20am on Thursday as tropical storm Nalgae moves away from Hong Kong and weakens.

The Observatory said the T3 signal would be issued as the storm was forecast to skirt the southern waters of Hong Kong as it heads towards the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary.

At 4am, Nalgae was centred about 50 kilometres west southwest of the Observatory, and was expected to move northwest at about 10 kilometres per hour.

Forecasters warned that gale force winds are still affecting southwestern parts of the territory, and said seas remain very rough. 

The T8 signal, issued at 1.40pm on Wednesday, was the first one issued in November since 1972.

School classes, as well as most bus and ferry services, were suspended.

The government received 11 reports of fallen trees during the storm. There were no reports of landslides or flooding.

File photo: RTHK The government has revealed that Financial Secretary Paul Chan tested positive upon arrival in Hong Kong on Tuesday evening, but stressed that he had recovered from Covid and therefore did not need to be isolated.

The clarification came after Chan attended a top level investment summit hosted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on Wednesday, a day after flying back from Saudi Arabia where he was diagnosed with Covid 19 last week.

In a statement issued late on Wednesday, a government spokesman said Chan's PCR test result was positive, but that his Ct value – which indicates the viral load in a sample – was within the range of recovered cases.

The spokesman said that the Centre for Health Protection had evaluated the official's health declaration record and his PCR test result in accordance with established procedures, adding that he was asymptomatic and had obtained a negative rapid test result before boarding a flight to Hong Kong.

The government denied that the finance chief was given special treatment.

According to the records of the [Department of Health], from September 26 to November 1, a total of 455 inbound travellers who declared a past history of Covid 19 infection within three months prior to arrival at Hong Kong, tested PCR positive upon arrival and were asymptomatic with relatively high Ct values by PCR test, the spokesman said.

They were regarded as recovered cases and not contagious, [and] they were not given [an] isolation order [or a] Red Code as they were not regarded as new infections or contagious.

Authorities added that Chan had to follow measures which applied to other participants from overseas when attending the summit, and that he would not attend banquets at the event as a precautionary measure.";Radio Television Hong Kong

Image courtesy of the Hong Kong Observatory The Observatory has announced that the No. 8 Gale or Storm Signal will remain in force until at least 5am on Thursday, as Tropical Storm Nalgae continued to approach the Pearl River Estuary.

As of 1am, the storm was centred around 50 kilometres south southeast of the Hong Kong Observatory.

Under the combined effect of Nalgae and the northeast monsoon, gale force winds are affecting the southern part of Hong Kong Island, the Observatory said in a statement.

It added that the storm would weaken further and that a lower tropical cyclone warning signal would be issued when it weakens into a tropical depression or when local winds subside significantly.

Secretary for the Civil Service Ingrid Yeung Ho Poi yan called on parents to get their children vaccinated and hopes the bookings will come through on the weekend. Some parents took their children to get the jab at Hong Kong Children's Hospital, including a mother with her four year old son. The mother said her elder daughter received the German made BioNTech shots, but did not suffer side effects. Our family was cautious and rarely went outside because we knew our son was unvaccinated and was at the highest risk. Since he is vaccinated now, we hope we can go outside and dine in at restaurants more frequently, she said. The BioNTech vaccine for toddlers is only available at four centers: Hong Kong Children's Hospital, HKU Children Community Vaccination Centre at Gleneagles Hospital Hong Kong, CUHK Medical Centre and Osman Ramju Sadick Memorial Sports Centre. Based on the 750 bookings made as of Tuesday evening, Yeung said the population of children aged below three is around 104,000, but only nearly 19 percent of the children in this age group have received their first dose of Covid 19 vaccine. But she added that the situation is understandable as parents might not be able to arrange vaccinations during weekdays. Parents might have travel plans for Christmas holidays, even if the time is short for receiving three doses before their departure, I hope that parents would stop their vaccine hesitancy and arrange the first dose vaccination for their children immediately, and let them receive their second dose before their trip if the time allows, she said. Yeung's call came as Hong Kong saw 5,068 cases   4,570 local and 498 imported   and 13 deaths, which included a 31 month old boy. Of the reported cases, 742 came from 522 schools, and 19 classes were suspended for a week. Seven elderly homes and four disabled homes reported 22 infections. Subsidised Primary School Council chairwoman Vu Im fan said schools will still implement strict measures as 35 primary schools will resume full day in person classes next month. While the Education Bureau no longer requires schools to set up plastic barriers during lunch, Vu said schools might still want to use them to lower the risk.

The two are among six names reckoned to have received Beijing's blessing to compete with four seats vacant. The others are Adrian Ho King hong, nephew of former Macau chief executive Edmund Ho Hau wah, of the New People's Party, Shang Hailong, general manager of artificial intelligence software firm SenseTime, Chan Wing kwong of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, and Lee Kwong yu of the Federation of Trade Unions The polls on December 18 are to fill seats vacated after four legislators joined Chief Executive John Lee Ka chiu's administration in July. On yesterday's ninth day of the nomination period, Gary Wong, 39, was the first to submit his application to the Registration and Electoral Office, making his third attempt to become a legislator. He lost in the 2016 election for the Hong Kong Island constituency and in last year's polls for the Election Committee constituency, when he came 42nd and could not join the 40 member group. Showing up with Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Standing Committee member Anthony Wu Ting yuk and former secretary for constitutional and mainland affairs Raymond Tam Chi yuen, Wong said: Success or failure is not determined by just an election or two. He noted he has experience in local affairs and also has a broad horizon on national and international levels, adding that he will promote the SAR's advantages with the mainland and promote Hong Kong to the world. It is understood Wong has gathered 20 nominations, including from medical and health sector legislator David Lam Tzit yuen and Heung Yee Kuk legislative representative Kenneth Lau Ip keung. Wong Kam fai, also vice chairman of Hong Kong Alliance of Technology and Innovation, submitted his nomination accompanied by National People's Congress deputy Herman Hu Shao ming, Legislative Council technology and innovation sector representative Duncan Chiu and his Election Committee counterpart Stephen Wong Yuen shan. Wong remarked that since IT veteran Sun Dong left Legco to become secretary for innovation, technology and industry the council has been in need of technology experts, and so he believes he is a solid candidate. My profession is to make judgments based on data, he said, and I hope to make policies in a scientific way.

The four charged by the Independent Commission Against Corruption were physiotherapist Wong Chi yan, 42, unemployed Mabel Yick, 58, graphic designer Wu Hong ki, 44, and financial dealer Kwok Kin chiu, 29. They each face one count of engaging in illegal conduct to incite another person not to vote, or to cast invalid vote, by activity in public during the election period. They are out on bail pending an appearance in Eastern magistrates' courts Friday to make their pleas. The ICAC said Wong and Yick reposted a call by self exiled former lawmaker Ted Hui Chi fung to their own social media accounts during election which the ordinance defined as being from when nominations started on October 30 to voting day on December 19. Wu reposted on his social media page a call made by self exiled activist Sunny Cheung Kwan yeung on his social media page inciting others not to vote . And Kwok reposted a social media call call by former district councilor Yau Man chun, who resides abroad, inciting others not to vote. Warrants for the arrest of Hui, Cheung and Yau had been issued by magistrates in late 2021. On July 27 this year, two men were charged by the ICAC of the same offense. So Tsun fung, the 22 year old former president of Chinese University's student union, was charged for sharing a post by Hui inciting others not to vote between October 30 and December 15. Construction worker Chan Sing, 55, too was charged for allegedly sharing the same post between October 30 and November 21.

In a written judgment yesterday, court of appeal vice presidents Susan Kwan Shuk hing, and Carlye Chu Fun ling and appeal judge Thomas Au Hing cheung said the trial is of great general public importance that would impact substantially the development of national security law jurisprudence and sedition offenses. Public perception of fairness in the trial is of vital importance to the administration of justice. The court must adopt a flexible and sensible approach to arrive at a decision that would best suit the public interest, they said. It is clearly in the public interest to grant the application for admission on grounds of public perception as well as the other grounds that have been canvassed. The appeal was lodged after high court chief judge Jeremy Poon Shiu chor ruled in October Owen can act as Lai's lawyer due to the unavailability of barristers and the case's complexity.

Action Asia Events announced on its Facebook page on Monday that the government had given it approval to hand out bananas at checkpoints. Runners are not allowed to consume the food within the checkpoints, it said. They are required to eat alone and avoid talking while eating. In response to an inquiry by The Standard, it said the approval of bananas was seen as a turning point, as food had been banned from all trail running events in Hong Kong since the pandemic began. It will be the first event in almost three years with some type of food being allowed, race director Michael Maddess said. Of course we would like to have no restrictions on food, but we have to start somewhere. We are hoping for further relaxations together with a 0+0 policy to drive tourism to Hong Kong. But some people asked how runners can do away with the banana peels, to which Action Asia Events said rubbish bags would be made available outside checkpoints. An expert said runners cannot merely rely on bananas during a trail race. Runners should bring their own food too, said Lee Yuet man, chairman of the Hong Kong Recreation and Sports Professionals General Union. Lee said runners should be careful as trail runs require sufficient training. During the pandemic, it is difficult for people to gain long lasting training on trail runs in Hong Kong, and even some professional runners are not able to complete a race, he said.

Also on Saturday, the museum in West Kowloon Cultural District will celebrate its first anniversary. That marks the end of a free entrance arrangement, so general admissions visitors will be charged HK$120 or HK$60 as a concessionary price. But to view the special exhibition Yayoi Kusama: 1945 to Now, which runs to May 14, they must pay HK$240 for a standard ticket and HK$150 for a concessionary for full access to all galleries. Among the three special works 93 year old Kusama has created for M+ are two yellow pumpkin sculptures covered in black dots that are already been placed in the museum's main hall for free public viewing. Pumpkins are a favorite Kusama subject and dots her best known motif. Another piece the museum commissioned is a large scale installation titled Death of Nerves installed in the light well connecting the ground floor and the basement levels. It features her signature infinity nets and comes with a poem she wrote. Her third creation for M+ is Dots Obsession: Aspiring to Heaven's Love. That is an immersive work in a mirrored studio with large balloons covered in white dots suspended from the ceiling. Spanning from Kusama's earliest work to her most recent output, the show is organized chronologically and thematically to walk visitors through her wide range of works. One of the most influential Asians in the history of contemporary art, Kusama was trained in traditional Japanese painting. She moved to the United States in 1957 and soon established herself in American and European avant garde for her unique and radical artistic language before she returned to Japan in 1973. The exhibition will examine her career in Japan, the United States, Europe and beyond through six themes: Infinity, Accumulation, Radical Connectivity, Biocosmic, Death and Force of Life. Walking into the exhibition, visitors will be greeted by a Kusama self portrait featuring her signature dots and favorite yellow color. Curatorial deputy director Doryun Chong says the exhibition can attract over 100,000 visitors. We have just had two million visitors, he said. I think we clearly have become a Hong Kong museum. So based on that we feel confident that even when the museum starts to charge people will come back. M+ and MTR Corp have also joined hands to bring Kusama's work of the two yellow pumpkins to trains on Tuen Ma Line until December 27. By scanning the QR codes in train compartments passengers can listen to an audio guide delivered by M+ curators introducing selected art work by the Japanese artist.

https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/4/247186/Camp-closures-under-attack;2022-11-10 00:00:00; Camp closures under attack The Standard;" Wallis Wang Legislative Council members blamed the government for not having a timetable for reopening public campsites that have been closed for more than two years due to the pandemic. But Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin wan said the government must adopt a prudent and orderly approach in relaxing anti epidemic measures. In a Legco meeting yesterday, Ben Chan Han pan of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong said it was unreasonable of the government to reopen beaches, barbecue sites and even the Rugby Sevens while keeping campsites shut. He also questioned whether the government chose not to reopen the campsites as they cannot bring economic benefits. He said camping had become a holiday leisure activity for many Hongkongers amid the pandemic. However, due to the closure of government campsites and a limited number of private ones, many people had to go camping in non country park sites or illegal areas. Tse said: We must adopt a prudent and orderly approach in relaxing various anti epidemic measures so as to avert a rebound of the epidemic situation and backtracking along the path to normalcy. The government differentiates people into different risk levels precisely and scientifically for proper control and, on the premise of management, allows the maximum degree of daily activities and participants involved, with a view to striking a balance among risks and economic impetus, he said. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department issued 353 warnings and launched 266 prosecutions against illegal camping activities between 2017 and 2021. However, the warnings already numbered 146 and the prosecutions 182 in the first three quarters this year, Tse said. The government has been enhancing facilities in country parks and allocated HK$500 million in the Budget last year. The AFCD would commission a study this year on setting up glamping facilities in country parks, Tse said. The potential sites include Tai Tong in Yuen Long, Tai Mong Tsai in Sai Kung and Rotary Park in Tai Mo Shan.

Customs earlier received information that a saleswoman of a wedding dress rental shop in Prince Edward was suspected of forcing a customer to procure a wedding dress rental service after she had tried on a wedding dress. Although the customer indicated that she would not purchase the rental service and would only pay for the necessary fitting fee, the saleswoman still made an unauthorized deduction of the rental fee from the customer's credit card. The saleswoman was then arrested by customs on Tuesday for engaging in aggressive commercial practices in the course of selling, in violation of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance. Investigations are ongoing and the saleswoman has been released on bail, according to customs. Customs reminded traders to comply with the requirements of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance and consumers to procure services at reputable shops. Any trader who engages in aggressive commercial practices and causes the consumer to make a transaction commits an offense.

The iconic Jumbo Floating Restaurant capsized and sank in the South China Sea on June 19 this year. After that, a shipyard said on Monday (November 7) that it is suing the barge's owners to return handling fees as the owners have not transferred the ownership of the barge to it in accordance with a contract. In a writ filed to the High Court on Monday, King Field Shipyard said Jumbo's parent company Aberdeen Restaurant Enterprises and Tai Pak Sea food Restaurant failed to address the agreement   which was signed on May 19   to transfer the ownership of four barges including Jumbo, to the shipyard, after it paid a HK$5.4 million handling fee. However, as the barge owner, Aberdeen Restaurant Enterprises paid a HK$600,000 deposit to the shipyard on May 20, Jumbo capsized while being towed out of Hong Kong. The shipyard, therefore, demanded the holder salvage the barge and pay compensation of HK$4.8 million. In a statement issued by Aberdeen Restaurant Enterprises today, it denied that there was still a contractual relationship with the shipyard. We have written to the shipyard on July 27 informing that the contract will be automatically terminated, said the enterprise, noting it was not in breach of contract. The enterprise added it would actively respond to the lawsuit and file a claim against it. According to the shipyard, under the original contract, Aberdeen Tai Pak Sea food Restaurant and Aberdeen Restaurant Enterprises were required to deliver the four barges by July 31. Even though being told on June 1 by the restaurant enterprises that Jumbo had capsized, the shipyard claimed it would still be willing to move forward with the contract.

Lam's remark came after lawmaker Tang Ka piu asked Wednesday if authorities will consider connecting the EKL terminus to Lam Tin Station or Yau Tong Station of the MTR Kwun Tong Line to form a loop linkage system in East Kowloon. Tang also referred to reports that the proposed EKL – adopting the elevated trackless rapid transit system – will only run through areas from Choi Hung to Sau Mau Ping. The rapid transit system is a different system from the heavy rail system run by MTR's trains. In the written reply, Lam said the alignment and station locations of the elevated trackless rapid transit system depend on factors including gradient, space for accommodating the elevated structures, construction methods, etc. 'Owing to the hilly topography with a large level difference from Po Tat to Lam Tin and Yau Tong areas, extending the rapid transit system from Po Tat Estate at the higher level to Lam Tin and Yau Tong areas at the lower level is difficult,' according to Lam. Lam continued if the rapid transit system was to be extended to Lam Tin and Yau Tong areas, it would need to pass by major roads such as Tseung Kwan O Road, the viaducts of Kwun Tong Bypass and Lei Yue Mun Road. The transport chief noted the space for the construction of the elevated corridor and stations is very limited, and the technical feasibility is relatively low. Lam went on to say that the underground heavy rail system will not be a practical option for EKL, as it would take a longer time for citizens to travel between the ground level and the train platforms deep underground. 'We are now exploring an elevated trackless rapid transit system from Po Tat via Sau Mau Ping, Shun On, Shun Lee, and Choi Wan connecting with Choi Hung MTR Station as an alternative,' Lam said. The rapid transit system being explored will operate on an elevated corridor to be completely separated from pedestrian and vehicular traffic. And it will not be affected by heavy traffic at Clear Water Bay Road, New Clear Water Bay Road, and Choi Hung Interchange, Lam pointed out.

Lawmaker Chan Han pan, in a written inquiry, asked Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin wan if authorities have a timeline in place for reopening the city's campsites, given that the social distancing measures for catering premises, beaches, bars, and certain places of entertainment have been recently relaxed. In response, Tse said the government operates under the principles of science based and targeted anti epidemic measures, as well as the proper management of risks and citizen focused facilitation. 'The government differentiates people into different risk levels precisely and scientifically for proper control and, on the premise of management, allow the maximum degree of daily activities and participants involved, with a view to striking a balance among risks and economic impetus,' he said. 'The government emphasizes that we must adopt a prudent and orderly approach in relaxing various anti epidemic measures so as to avert a rebound of the epidemic situation and backtracking along the path to normalcy,' said Tse, adding that authorities will closely monitor the latest development of the epidemic and review its anti epidemic measures. As for private campsites, Tse said authorities will step up inspections to ensure such campsites were operating by the books. Meanwhile, the environment chief noted that the government has earmarked HK$500 million in the 2021 Budget for carrying out various enhancement works on the facilities in some of the country parks   including the Sai Kung Wong Shek Campsite, Lau Shui Heung Campsite, and the Twisk Campsite. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department will also commission a consultancy study within this year on the feasibility of setting up glamping facilities in country parks, with a view to determining the site locations, design, mode of operation, fee level, and operation requirements, said Tse.

https://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news/section/4/196928/UK's-Timothy-Owen-KC-to-defend-Jimmy-Lai-in-December's-national-security-trial;2022-11-09 17:10:00; UK's Timothy Owen KC to defend Jimmy Lai in December's national security trial The Standard;" King's Counsel Timothy Owen from the UK is set to defend jailed media tycoon and former boss of now defunct Apply Daily Jimmy Lai Chee ying in his national security trial that starts in December after the Department of Justice lost its appeal. Lai, six executives of Next Digital – the parent company of Apply Daily, and the group's three subsidiaries were charged with colluding with foreign forces; and conspiracy to publish, distribute and display seditious publications between April 1, 2019, and June 24 last year. Lai was also charged with two counts of collusion between July 1, 2020, and February 15 last year, for calling on other countries and foreign agents to impose sanctions on China and Hong Kong. Lai and three subsidiaries – Apple Daily Ltd, Apple Daily Printing Ltd, and AD Internet Ltd – will plead not guilty. The trial has been scheduled for December 1 and is expected to last for 30 days before a panel of three designated national security judges. In mid October, the High Court's chief judge allowed Owen's ad hoc admission to represent Lai in the trial. The DoJ then filed an appeal against the decision but saw the appeal dismissed by the court. In the latest written judgment released Wednesday, the High Court explained that 'the forthcoming criminal trial is a high profile case attracting substantial publicity locally and abroad.' 'It involves the resolution of legal issues of great general public importance that would impact substantially on the development of NSL jurisprudence and sedition offenses. Public perception of fairness in the trial is of vital importance to the administration of justice.' The High Court went on to say it must adopt a flexible and sensible approach to arrive at a decision that would best suit the public interest in this application. 'It is clearly in the public interest to grant the application for admission on grounds of public perception as well as the other grounds that have been canvassed,' the judgment read. The court also ordered the Secretary for Justice to pay the legal costs. Previously, the DoJ argued that Owen does not have the experience in issues concerning the application of NSL under local laws, and that there is substantial experience in the local Bar in conducting such challenge. The six senior executives also facing prosecution are; Next Digital's former CEO Cheung Kim hung, Apple Daily's former associate publisher Chan Pui man, former editor in chief Ryan Law Wai kwong, former executive editor in chief Lam Man chung, former English edition editor in chief Fung Wai kong, and former editorial writer Yeung Ching kee. The six earlier said they would plead guilty in the hearing on November 22. Two other defendants in this case – fugitive Andy Li Yu hin and paralegal Chan Tsz wah – had pleaded guilty already. Their case will be mentioned on January 12 next year. Today's Standard Trademark and Copyright Notice: Copyright 2022, The Standard Newspaper Publishing Ltd., and its related entities.

https://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news/section/4/196927/No-interfering-in-university-affairs-over-emblem-change,-says-education-chief- ;2022-11-09 17:03:00; No interfering in university affairs over emblem change, says education chief The Standard;" Secretary for Education Christine Choi Yuk lin claimed today that Chinese University has abided by the regulations during the changing of its emblem, noting authority will not intervene in universities' internal governance. In response to lawmakers' argument about poor governance in universities at the Legislative Council on Wednesday, the education minister said the university's Administrative and Planning Committee, which made the decision to change the emblem, was statutorily established. The government will not interfere with institutions' governance and decision making, she said. The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) reverted to its old emblem last month after the new version existed for only seven days but faced rising public backlash criticizing its failure to conduct a public consultation before the logo change. Lawmaker Tommy Cheung Yu yan, one of the university's council members, questioned the Legislative Council that the public failed to effectively monitor such universities' governance, citing that the university council of CUHK was not informed of the emblem change. Lawmaker Priscilla Leung Mei fun said that public funded universities have been given too much discretion, which led to loopholes for the CUHK management board to disregard the council's opinion. Choi, however, said that various stakeholders in the community hold different opinions about the universities' governance, but it is important to have frank communication to come up with a common way forward in the best interests.

https://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news/section/4/196923/Prices-fly-for-Lunar-New-Year-fair-stalls;2022-11-09 15:55:00; Prices fly for Lunar New Year fair stalls The Standard;" A total of 175 wet goods stalls were let in an auction that started on Wednesday for stalls at the 2023 Victoria Park Lunar New Year Fair. A spokeswoman for the Food & Environmental Hygiene Department said the average bid price for the first 15 auctioned wet goods stalls was about HK$31,500, with the highest bid reaching HK$46,000   six times more than the opening price of HK$5,440. Speaking to reporters this afternoon, the department spokeswoman said there won't be any dry goods stalls and food stalls at the Lunar New Year Fairs across Hong Kong this year in view of the Covid epidemic. She said there will be more space for people to observe social distancing without the dry good and food stalls, thus, lowering the risk of Covid transmission. Crowd control measures will be implemented at the fairs, with the maximum number of visitors allowed inside the Victoria Park Lunar New Year Fair at the same time capped at 32,000, she said. The spokeswoman added that the fairs could be canceled should the city's epidemic situation take a bad turn. Flower vendor Kwok, who secured stall No.1 at the Victoria Park fair with a price of HK$36,000, said his winning bid was already lower than that in previous years, with a price reaching up to around HK$70,000. He believed the ban on dry goods and food stalls would not affect people's willingness to visit the fairs, as people are used to getting flowers for the new year. Meanwhile, Kwok said the epidemic had increased the shipping cost for his flowers from the mainland by about 40 to 50 percent, but he said the increased cost would not be reflected much in the selling price of his flowers. He added that he is confident to profit in this year's fair, which he intended to bid for four other stalls.

The four are physiotherapist Wong Chi yan, 42; unemployed Mabel Yick, 58; graphic designer Wu Hong ki, 44; and financial dealer Kwok Kin chiu, 29. They each face one count of engaging in illegal conduct to incite another person not to vote, or to cast invalid vote, by activity in public during election period between October 30 and December 19, 2021, in violation of the Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Conduct) Ordinance. Wong and Yick allegedly shared a social media post by Hui, where he incited others to cast a blank vote during the election period. Wu allegedly shared another social media post by Sunny Cheung Kwan yang, the former spokesperson of Hong Kong Higher Institutions International Affairs Delegation, where Cheung incited others not to vote in the election. As for Kwok, he allegedly displayed a social media post – originally published by former Sha Tin District Councilor Yau Man chun – to incite others not to vote. The four defendants have been released on bail and will appear in the Eastern Magistrates' Courts on Friday (Nov 11). Hui, Yau, and Cheung have left Hong Kong, and the court has issued arrest warrants for the trio. It is understood that Hui is now in Australia. In August, Hui was reportedly splashed with water and verbally threatened in a Hong Kong style cha chaan teng there.

It is obvious that the pandemic in Hong Kong has become stable during the six week period after the '0+3' format launched,the pro Beijing lawmaker Jeffrey Lam Kin fung said at a conference on Wednesday. More convenient disease prevention measures are of priority currently, such as reducing the times for new arrivals to undergo nucleic acid tests for rapid tests instead, he noted. Lam added that a shorter commuting procedure on the border crossing travels with the mainland is more expected since the largest group of tourists inbound are from China. And it is time for the authority to negotiate with airlines to add more flights to embrace more travelers to Hong Kong to boost the resumption of tourism, he said. Previously, the government announced that from November, travel groups in Hong Kong will be granted permission to enter designated tourist attractions, even though holding an Amber Health Code, and dine in designated catering premises.

https://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news/section/4/196909/Teacher-arrested-for-false-reports-of-school-abuse  ;2022-11-09 13:08:00; Teacher arrested for false reports of school abuse The Standard;" A female teacher at a special school was arrested for falsely reporting faculty abuse of students due to dissatisfaction with her work. Police announced today to arrest of the 48 year old teacher of Hong Chi Pinehill No.2 School on Monday on suspicion of publishing anonymous letters falsely claiming to be a student's parent and reporting that her child was being abused by the school. In October this year, the Education Bureau said it received complaints from parents that revealed long period physical child abuse accidents in the school, including faculty tying up children's hands and suffocating them by putting a towel over their faces, with video clips attached. The involved school, Hong Chi Pinehill No 2 School, released a statement afterward to deny the mistreatment, saying receiving parents' contact to clarify the misconduct toward children by teachers was not true. After several investigations, officers found that the abuse allegations were exaggerated and false. No child abuse was detected as officers investigated around 19,000 hours of the school's camera surveillance footage from June to August this year. The video clips attached to the letters, which claimed to record the children's abuse scene, were found to have been made four to eight years ago. We noticed that the content of the anonymous letters was directed at the school's management board, said the police, we believed the person who wrote the letters was dissatisfied with the school's staff. The arrestee, who has been working as an English teacher in the school for more than 10 years, is now detained with police finding a computer and a printer in her office, which were believed to be used for making the anonymous letters.

Please refresh the page and/or try again. In March, 2021, Beijing passed legislation to ensure 'patriots' govern Hong Kong. The move reduced democratic representation in the legislature, tightened control of elections and introduced a pro Beijing vetting panel to select candidates. The Hong Kong government said the overhaul would ensure the city's stability and prosperity. But the changes also prompted international condemnation, as it makes it near impossible for pro democracy candidates to stand. There is putting a brave face on bad news, there is spin, and there are outright falsities. All three were on offer after the latest Legco elections, spurned by more than 70 percent of the registered voters.

https://hongkongfp.com/hong-kong-free-press-annual-report-2021/;; Hong Kong Free Press Annual Report 2021; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit Our latest Annual Report includes a Transparency Report based on our latest yearly, independent audit. Letter from the Editor Dear readers and supporters, Over the past year, the HKFP newsroom underwent a transformation – we expanded, professionalised, moving to a new, larger, private office. We doubled our freelance budget, hired three new staff, won a SOPA award, and produced almost 150 fully fledged original features. Our team covered the first 'patriots only' election, Covid 19, the national security law, and we exceeded our Funding Drive target, bringing 1,000 monthly Patrons online. But 2021 was also a brutal year for the media industry in Hong Kong, with newsrooms raided, editors arrested and outlets disbanding in fear. In all, over 60 civil society groups disappeared last year, all whilst the authorities said press freedom was intact, deeming foreign criticism of journalist arrests a violation of international law. Yet we are continuing our work. HKFP was founded seven years ago as a response to press freedom concerns, but – aside from our 2020 work visa denial – our newsroom has never been directly troubled by the authorities. This is likely owing to our impartial stance, transparent funding, and balanced coverage guided by an Ethics Code and Corrections Policy. Press freedom is guaranteed by the Basic Law, Bill of Rights and security law – it is in our name, and it is on this basis that we operate. For these reasons, HKFP staff are united in our commitment to continue our on the ground award winning reporting. Nonetheless, we cannot be naïve when it comes to ensuring staff safety and security, protecting sources, and trying our best to navigate unclear legal realities whilst test cases go through court. We are a Hong Kong news outlet, we love this city, and we have not entertained the idea of reporting on it from elsewhere. Besides, it is only by being on the ground that we can maintain nuance and accuracy through attending events, press conferences, court cases and speaking directly with Hongkongers. But because of the current uncertainties facing journalists, we may make some precautionary changes this year upon legal advice. Above all though, we will always be guided by the journalistic tradition, our ethics code, and the day to day mission of ensuring accuracy and fairness. And despite recent events, we do not believe there are any Hong Kong stories we would have to avoid reporting. I am happy to present our Annual Report, as we round up our best coverage, achievements, and our accounts from the past 12 months. During this coming year, we look forward to covering the city's leadership race, the 25 th anniversary of the Handover, the pandemic and court cases. And with your support and readership, the HKFP team will continue to hold the line and press on! Our Mission & Impact Founded in 2015, Hong Kong Free Press is an impartial, non profit, award winning English language newspaper. Run by journalists, backed by readers and completely independent, HKFP is governed by a public code of ethics. Best of 2021 Original features: Our features in 2021 documented Hong Kong's transformation under the shadow of the Beijing enacted security law. We delved into how counsellors and psychologists grappled with the fear of creeping self censorship in their practice, how booksellers were reported to the national security police during the Hong Kong Book Fair for selling politically sensitive titles, and how one of the city's last remaining independent bookstores shuttered, citing the political environment. We also looked at how the city's filmmakers, publishers and street artists navigated the shifting red lines, and how some Hongkongers are inking messages of resistance onto their own skin. The city's media landscape forever changed last year with the closure of pro democracy newspaper Apple Daily. HKFP was at its newsrooms and printing presses on its last day of operations. We also explored how the city's Beijing backed press are gaining more influence. The year also saw the mass resignations of pro democracy district councillors after new oath requirements were introduced. We documented the final days of one local councillor in office and explored how the exodus of district representatives also left community newspapers struggling. As protest related and national security cases piled up in the city's courts, we spoke with lawyers compiling a protest case database to preserve the city's rule of law, the activists writing letters to detained protesters, and the international lawyers who launched an advice website to inform Hongkongers of their legal rights. We also spoke with a refugee from Vietnam who was stuck behind bars for almost three decades after being convicted of murder as a teenager, and eventually decided to abandon his fight against deportation. Amid the changes of 2021, a wave of Hongkongers left for the UK. HKFP was at the airport when long queues formed as people bid farewell to loved ones. In the UK, we reported on the people helping newly arrived Hongkongers settle in, as well the pro China groups pressuring them. Hong Kong also saw the implementation of a sweeping overhaul of the city's electoral system. HKFP gave extensive coverage on the day of the city's first 'patriots only' legislative election – candidates made urgent appeal to voters while Hong Kong saw the lowest turnout rate ever. Following a 48 hour purge of Tiananmen Massacre monuments from university campuses over Christmas, we also spoke with students, academics, as well as artists behind the statues about what the removals meant for Hong Kong's efforts to commemorate those who died in the military crackdown of student led demonstrations over 32 years ago. Our team visited local businesses at risk of forced closure after government led redevelopments in Fo Tan and Kwun Tong. Elsewhere, we spoke with the owners of Hong Kong's remaining iconic Dai Pai Dongs facing eviction from their community, and the elderly villager fighting to save his home from developers in the New Territories. We also reported on the opening of the newly revamped historic Central Market and the long awaited M+ museum. Covid 19 restrictions continued to disrupt Hongkongers' daily lives last year. We examined government statistics to question whether the city's severe quarantine measures were really necessary, how even vaccinated people were forced into quarantine centres, how foreign domestic workers faced more challenging working conditions during the pandemic, and the rise in discrimination against South East Asians. We also delved into the trend of 'vaccine selfies,' how pandemic related pressure on airlines led some pilots to accuse companies of age discrimination, and the plight of those left stranded in the UK during Hong Kong's months long flight suspensions. Our pandemic coverage also tackled how the coronavirus made life even more difficult in the city's sub divided flats, the refugees excluded from the city's vaccination programme, how local mask manufacturers survived in an inundated market, and how local businesses responded to the government mandated tracing app. Beyond politics, we delved into the world of polyamory to explore how some Hongkongers navigate romantic ties beyond traditional partnerships, explored the little known history of siu mai, met the bus fanatics turning Hong Kong bus seats into office chairs, and published a probe into one of the city's oldest sporting associations. We also looked at how a Muslim headscarf sparked a discrimination row at a school and how volunteers helped to restore Hong Kong's Hindu cemetery. 2021 was also a big year for Hong Kong sports. We spoke to local athletes during the Tokyo games to learn about daily life at the Olympic village, as well as to the city's Paralympians about their dreams of sporting glory. We continued to cover environmental and animal stories last year, including the threat to rare porpoises posed by a development off Lantau, and the task force fighting against dog poisonings. Last year, we produced 144 fully fledged features, over 35 interviews, 256 opinion pieces and 276 stories on the 'patriots only' elections. We have also published over 1,000 stories on the national security law, and over 1,000 on Covid 19. HKFP Venture also relaunched with over a dozen guides to outdoor adventures. We expanded our coverage from across the Taiwan Strait, profiling the people fighting for dual citizenship, Hong Kong artists in self exile, the Hongkongers seeking to contribute to Taiwanese society, the launch of an ambitious new English language news platform, and the Hongkongers who have joined the local movement to revive the use of Taiwanese in daily life. We also spoke with the Taiwanese maths teacher posting educational videos on Pornhub, cautiously asking: why? Over the border in mainland China, we reported on a Hongkonger with a history of mental illness who was executed for drug trafficking despite pleas from family and rights groups. And further afield, we reported on the Hongkongers fighting for democracy in Myanmar after the military coup. Explanatory Reporting: HKFP continued its monthly explainer series on how the city has changed under the Beijing enacted security law, and we continued our 'shifting narratives' series on how the city's leaders' attitude towards the Tiananmen Massacre and the traditional mass pro democracy marches on July 1 evolved over recent years. We wrote explainers on major political developments, including how Beijing overhauled the city's electoral system, how authorities moved to erase the memory of Tiananmen, and how the largest teachers' union was forced to dissolve. We also explained how Hongkongers still found ways to resist despite the national security clampdown. HKFP also examined trends in leader Carrie Lam's past policy addresses after she delivered the last one of her current term, analysing what it all meant for the city's future. We broke down how Beijing's overhaul of the city's electoral process ensured that almost every candidate for the new Election Committee was guaranteed a seat. We looked at where Beijing's national security crackdown has left the city's pro democracy camp, and who the approved candidates were in the city's first legislative poll following the sweeping overhaul. Our team also wrote practical guides informing our readers how to sign up for the government's electronic stimulus vouchers, how to enter lucky draws for the fully vaccinated, how to get vaccinated against Covid 19, and how to write letters to prisoners. Interviews: Last year, we touched in again with Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei about what he saw as the future of art in the city. We also spoke with Democratic Party leader Lo Kin hei about the party's future in the shifting political climate, and political scientist Ma Ngok on what Beijing's electoral overhaul means for democracy in Hong Kong. At the other end of the political spectrum, we spoke to the founder of the new pro Beijing Bauhinia Party Charles Wong, and pro establishment lawmaker Michael Tien on the future of Hong Kong politics. We also sat down with pro Beijing figure Adrian Ho about running one of the city's largest pro establishment online communities. We spoke with a number of activists before they were put behind bars, including democrat and labour activist Raphael Wong ahead of his sentencing for an unauthorised assembly, and student activist Wong Yat chin before he was arrested and denied bail under the security law. We also spoke to other dissidents, including former student leader Owen Au about what he saw as the future of protest in the city and investigative journalist Bao Choy after her conviction over accessing public records for a documentary on alleged police collusion with triads. We interviewed dissidents elsewhere in the region, including Singaporean activist Jolovan Wham about his arrest after a one man protest. And during the Tokyo Olympics, we were the first newspaper to catch up with Hong Kong's only gold medal winner, fencer Edgar Cheung, about how he kept calm under pressure. Arts: We also sat down with the city's creatives, including the director of the protest documentary 'Revolution of our Times' Kiwi Chow about why he is staying put in the city, musician Cehryl on the impact of Covid on live music, artist Sampson Wong on finding beauty in Hong Kong, and Yim Chiu tong, the Plumber King, whose advertisements became part of a street art exhibition. In Taiwan, our reporter interviewed the island's only weed lawyer, a politician defending democracy on Matsu island 17 km from mainland China, and dissident Wu'er Kaixi ahead of the 32nd anniversary of the Tiananmen Massacre. And we also spoke with Taipei based singer Kimberley Chen about shrugging off China's censors. Authors: We spoke with journalist and author Joanna Chiu about her new book detailing China's web of influence abroad and Western complicity in China's rise, and veteran journalist Stephen Vines about his last book on Hong Kong before he fled back to the UK. 'Patriots poll: Ahead of the city's first 'patriots only' legislative race, we spoke to three candidates from across the political spectrum including self proclaimed non pro establishment Adrian Lau, Vincent Diu, an electrician who declared as independent, and Nixie Lam, who was seen by her pro establishment supporters as their international spokesperson. After the race, we also sat down with Tik Chi yuen, the only lawmaker elect who claimed to be non pro establishment. Scoops: We broke the story of how mainland Chinese and Hong Kong Wikipedia users were fighting over the narrative of the Hong Kong protests on the site, and the ensuing safety concerns for Hong Kong users. As a result of our report on the Wikipedia wars, the site banned seven mainland Chinese users for 'infiltration and exploitation.' We found Hong Kong public libraries had removed almost a fifth of titles relating to the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre from their shelves since 2009, and that the Bar Association had launched probes into legal icons Martin Lee and Margaret Ng after their convictions for unauthorised assembly. We also broke the story of how city authorities spent millions of taxpayer dollars to lobby Washington against the passing of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. 2020 Achievements NewsStream project complete: In 2019, HKFP won a US$78,400 (HK$615,440) Google News Initiative grant to create an open source funding platform for small newsrooms focussed on nurturing reader membership.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/10/75-of-hongkongers-disagree-city-is-in-public-health-emergency-majority-oppose-covid-vaccine-pass-survey/;2022-11-10 08:00:00+08:00; 75% of Hongkongers disagree city is in 'public health emergency', majority oppose Covid Vaccine Pass: survey; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit Around three quarters of Hongkongers do not think the city's Covid 19 situation constitutes a 'public health emergency.' The Democratic Party released results on Wednesday of its questionnaire about public attitudes towards Covid 19 and the government's related measures. A total of 75.6 per cent of people disagreed that Hong Kong was experiencing a 'public health emergency' per the government's definition, which refers to a situation with a 'high probability of causing a large number of deaths' or a 'large number of serious disabilities.' Around two percent and 11.4 per cent of respondents indicated 'strongly agree' and 'agree,' respectively. The party surveyed 853 people on the phone via random sampling between October 24 and last Saturday, a press release read. More than 82.6% people disagree the effectiveness of Vaccine Pass. The disagreement is in a landslide. I don't see govt offer any reasonable justification in continuing 599L. Govt should drop 599L immediately. https://t.co/GpN6wqMA9z Respondents were also asked how they felt about the government's anti epidemic rules, including the Vaccine Pass scheme, the group gathering ban, and the mandatory mask rule. The Vaccine Pass scheme, which requires people to be vaccinated to enter restaurants and other businesses, proved the least popular with over 82 per cent believing it was ineffective at stopping the spread of Covid 19. Just 0.7 per cent selected 'strongly agree.' The Democratic Party said the government introduced the Vaccine Pass to 'force' people to get vaccinated against Covid 19. 'But now, most people have already gotten the vaccine, and those who have not have their own [medical] reasons,' the party wrote in a statement, adding the scheme had 'completed its historical mission.' Meanwhile, the questions about the group gathering ban and the mask rule yielded more division. A total of 66 per cent of respondents 'strongly disagreed' or 'disagreed' that the ban on group gatherings – currently capped at 12 people – could help control the emidemic. Around 65 per cent said they agreed with the city's mask wearing rules. Hong Kong currently requires face coverings both indoors and outdoors. Hong Kong maintains many stringent Covid 19 rules that much of the world have long abandoned, with the past three years marked by disruptions to in person schooling, cumbersome rules for inbound travellers and on again, off again business closures. The unpopular hotel quarantine requirement for arrivals was scrapped in September following criticism from business groups and lawmakers. The population believed the city had made significant sacrifices under such rules, the Democratic Party's survey found. Asked whether they agreed Hong Kong was 'paying too much social and economic cost to keep the current public health measures in place,' 76 per cent answered 'strongly agree' or 'agree.' The city's economy contracted for a third consecutive quarter in the period ending in September, government figures released at the end of last month showed. Authorities, however, blamed the 'worsened external environment' and rising interest rates globally. Lo Kin hei, the chairperson of the Democratic Party, said Hongkongers had their doubts about whether the city should continue enforcing its strict anti epidemic rules. 'Hong Kong's relaxation of Covid rules is slower than its main Asian competitors  Hong Kong's status as an international finance centre continues to be eroded, and the aviation, logistics and tourism industries are seeing unprecedented blows,' the statement read. The party called on the government to respond to Hong Kong people's wishes, for example by scrapping the '0+3' requirement that bars new arrivals from visiting restaurants and other businesses in their first three days in the city.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/09/4-people-charged-over-inciting-others-to-cast-blank-votes-in-hong-kong-legislative-polls/;2022-11-09 18:22:00+08:00; 4 people charged over 'inciting others to cast blank votes' in Hong Kong legislative polls; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit Hong Kong's anti corruption watchdog has charged four people for allegedly 'inciting others to cast blank votes or not to vote' in the 2021 Legislative Council election. The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Wednesday accused physiotherapist Wong Chi yan, graphic designer Wu Hong ki, financial dealer Kwok Kin chiu and Mabel Yick, unemployed, of 'reposting or displaying on their respective social media pages' posts by pro democracy activists asking people not to vote or cast an invalid ballot, according to a statement. 'Each faces one count of engaging in illegal conduct to incite another person not to vote, or to cast invalid vote, by activity in public during election period, contrary to Section 27A(1) of the Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Conduct) Ordinance (ECICO),' the ICAC said. The four suspects were released on ICAC bail and will appear in court on Friday. They allegedly shared or reposted originally posted by former lawmaker Ted Hui, ex district councillor Yau Man chun or activist Sunny Cheung. The three activists have all left the city and are in self exile, with Hui in Australia, Yau in the UK and Cheung in the US. Hong Kong has issued arrest warrants for the trio. According to previous press releases and news reports, more than a dozen people have been arrested over the activists' posts. They include former district councillors and student leaders. In March, 2021, Beijing passed legislation to ensure 'patriots' govern Hong Kong. The move reduced democratic representation in the legislature, tightened control of elections and introduced a pro Beijing vetting panel to select candidates. The Hong Kong government said the overhaul would ensure the city's stability and prosperity. But the changes also prompted international condemnation, as it makes it near impossible for pro democracy candidates to stand. The poll saw a record low turnout of 30.2 per cent, with all but one of the 90 seats won by pro establishment candidates. It also saw the highest percentage of blank votes cast – at about two per cent of the total – since the Handover in 1997.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/09/national-security-trial-of-17-hong-kong-democrats-over-unofficial-primaries-to-begin-on-jan-30/;2022-11-09 17:00:00+08:00; National security trial of 17 Hong Kong democrats over unofficial primaries to begin on Jan 30; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit The high profile trial of 17 Hong Kong pro democracy figures who have pleaded not guilty in the city's largest national security case is set to commence on January 30, 2023, by which time some of the defendants would have been detained for almost two years. Former lawmakers Helena Wong, 'Long Hair' Leung Kwok hung, Ray Chan, Lam Cheuk ting and 13 other defendants who have denied playing a part in an alleged conspiracy to commit subversion will face a 90 day trial tentatively starting on January 30 next year, High Court judges Andrew Chan, Wilson Chan and Johnny Chan said on Wednesday. The Department of Justice (DoJ) will be represented by Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions (Special Duties) Anthony Chau and Jonathan Man Tak ho, lead prosecutor Andy Lo told the court. Chau has overseen numerous national security cases, including the prosecution of activist Tong Ying kit in the first ever trial under the Beijing imposed security law last July. A pre trial review for the 17 democrats is set to take place on January 17. The hearing may be held in two sessions due to the large number of defendants and legal representatives involved. The three judge panel requested the prosecution to file their opening submission by December 16, as well as a set of admitted facts agreed by both parties by December 30. It was the first time for the court to announce a date for the trial, after the case involving a total of 47 well known politicians and activists was first mentioned in March last year. Many defendants have been held in custody for more than 20 months, with only 13 democrats currently on bail. The alleged conspiracy centred on unofficial legislative primary elections held in July 2020, which aimed to help the pro democracy camp select candidates for an upcoming Legislative Council election. The defendants were said to have intended to abuse their powers as lawmakers to veto budget bills, paralyse government operations and eventually force the chief executive to resign had they secured a majority in the legislature. So far, 30 defendants have pleaded guilty and are awaiting mitigation and sentencing. The three judges have yet to decide whether the democrats will face penalty before or after the trial of the 17 who denied the charge. Judge Andrew Chan on Wednesday said he would 'reward counsels by saving time' in a trial as lengthy as the one facing the democrats. 'I will make counsels' lives very difficult if they are dragging the case on,' he said. Unlike most trials in Hong Kong's common law system, the case will not be tried by a jury after Secretary for Justice Paul Lam in August cited 'involvement of foreign elements' in the case as a reason of departing from a jury trial. He also cited concerns over the 'personal safety of jurors and their family members' and a 'risk of perverting the course of justice if the trial is conducted with a jury.' Ex legislator Lam and activist Owen Chow will stand trial in separate criminal cases next year which will likely clash with the security law trial. The current case is to 'take priority,' said Andrew Chan, who informed the chief magistrate and chief district judge about the timetable conflict. Prominent activist Joshua Wong and former Democratic Party chairman Wu Chi wai, were among the defendants who attended Wednesday's case management hearing even though they belong to the group of democrats who have pleaded guilty. As the democrats in custody were escorted out of the dock by corrections officers, their family and friends and members of the public stood up and waved at them. 'Hang in there,' some court attendees said. In June 2020, Beijing inserted national security legislation directly into Hong Kong's mini constitution – bypassing the local legislature – following a year of pro democracy protests and unrest. It criminalised subversion, secession, collusion with foreign forces and terrorist acts. The move gave police sweeping new powers, alarming democrats, civil society groups and trade partners, as such laws have been used broadly to silence and punish dissidents in China. However, authorities say it has restored stability and peace to the city.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/09/3-women-accused-of-child-abuse-at-hong-kong-care-centre-granted-bail/;2022-11-09 16:40:00+08:00; 3 women accused of child abuse at Hong Kong care centre granted bail; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit Three care workers accused of child abuse at a residential child care centre run by Hong Kong charitable organisation Po Leung Kuk have been granted bail. The women – surnamed Chow, 33, Ding, 28, Lui, 25 – appeared in front of Principal Magistrate Peter Law at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts on Wednesday, local media reported. Lui was arrested on Tuesday, while Chow and Ding were apprehended back in September but were granted bail. They all worked as child care providers in the 'babies section' of the Po Leung Kuk centre in Causeway Bay. The prosecution asked to adjourn the case as there were more than 50,000 hours of security camera footage and documents to be reviewed, Ming Pao reported. Law adjourned the case to March 29, while granting all defendants a cash bail of $10,000. They cannot leave Hong Kong and must report to the police once a week. They are also barred from entering the Po Leung Kuk facility and contacting any other employees. The trio stand accused of a total of eight counts of 'ill treatment or neglect by those in charge of [a] child or young person,' involving six children under three years old. The alleged offences happened from August 25 until September 14. An anonymity order was granted to protect the victims' identities. The alleged abuse first came to light during an inspection by the Social Welfare Department in mid September, when officials found a child being repeatedly pushed onto a play mat by an employee. More incidents of mistreatment were discovered when the department reviewed the centre's security camera footage. The defence revealed that Chow and Ding have resigned, according to Ming Pao, while Lui currently works as a clerk at Po Leung Kuk, but will submit her resignation to adhere to her bail conditions. Meanwhile, police on Wednesday said that reports of suspected child abuse at Hong Chi Pinehill No. 2 School, an institution for students with intellectual disabilities, were unsubstantiated. A 48 year old teacher at the school was arrested for making false reports of abuse after sending anonymous letters and videos of alleged abuses to parents, the Education Bureau and the media. Reports of alleged child abuse at the special needs school came to light in early October, with teachers being accused of mistreating students by tying their wrists and covering a child's head with a jacket when they threw a tantrum. The teacher was arrested on Monday on suspicion of accessing a computer with dishonest intent and causing wasteful employment of the police. Laptops, memory sticks, stacks of envelopes and postage stamps were among the evidence collected from her residence and office. Police said the allegations made against the school and certain teaching staff were 'exaggerated and false' after speaking with the parties involved and reviewing school records. The videos that appeared to show physical mistreatment were filmed four to eight years ago, they said, with some filmed secretly by the suspect, who has worked at the school for 10 years. 'The content of the letters targeted the school's management and specific teaching staff. We do not rule out that someone fabricated the anonymous letters accusing staff of abusing children out of dissatisfaction with their working arrangements,' Chief Inspector Mo Siu hei said. Mo said the police strongly condemned acts that abused a mechanism aimed at protecting children for personal motives such as revenge.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/09/chinas-national-security-agency-buys-hk508-million-luxury-villa-in-hong-kong/;2022-11-09 15:42:00+08:00; China's national security agency in Hong Kong buys HK$508 million luxury villa; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit China's national security agency in Hong Kong spent HK$508 million ($65 million) on a luxury villa in an exclusive neighbourhood perched on a hill above the city, registry data has revealed. The purchase last month offers a rare glimpse into an organisation which was set up in the Chinese finance hub more than two years ago but remains opaque and free from public scrutiny. The Office for Safeguarding National Security of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region was listed as the buyer of the largest villa at the Mont Rouge residential project in the Beacon Hill district, according to a Land Registry document. The 666 square metre (7,171 square foot) mansion has five bedrooms, three car parking spaces, a garden, its own lift and is described by its developer as 'a residential jewel that secures panoramic views, low density and luxuriant living'. The sale set a record for the most expensive house sold in the Kowloon district on a per square foot basis, according to local media. Beijing's national security office in Hong Kong was established in July 2020 following huge and sometimes violent democracy protests, alongside the imposition of a sweeping security law which has since ensnared more than 200 people, including many of the city's best known democracy activists. The security law empowered China's mainland security apparatus to operate openly in Hong Kong for the first time where their agents can conduct their own investigations and are not bound by the city's laws. The office requisitioned two hotels on Hong Kong's main island to be its temporary headquarters, while an 11,500 square metre government plot has been earmarked for a permanent base. A Hong Kong government spokesperson said the national security office is funded directly by the central government. Hong Kong has been rated the world's least affordable place to buy property for multiple years by the Demographia International Housing Affordability, outstripping famously pricey cities like Sydney and Vancouver. According to Demographia, it would take 23.2 years for a local resident to buy a home even without spending any of their income. The city's sky high property prices have taken a hit in the last six months, weighed down by Covid curbs, political turmoil, population outflow and dampened mainland China demand. But rising interest rates have made mortgages for the average resident become more expensive, impacting affordability even as the property market slides.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/09/name-hong-kongs-parks-after-chinese-heroes-not-colonial-figures-pro-beijing-lawmaker-proposes/;2022-11-09 12:54:00+08:00; Name Hong Kong's parks after Chinese heroes not colonial figures, pro Beijing lawmaker proposes; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit A Hong Kong lawmaker has suggested renaming public parks and playgrounds bearing colonial references to honour present day and historical Chinese heroes. Junius Ho raised the proposal in a Legislative Council (LegCo) meeting, citing Chinese leader Xi Jinping's previous statements that Chinese people must have 'national self confidence.' 'We must strengthen civic education,' Ho said. 'Why aren't we innovative [in the naming of our public facilities]?' The lawmaker's comments came as legislators discussed the removal of the word 'temporary' from five government run parks in the Central and Western District, among them Brewin Path Temporary Playground and Forbes Street Temporary Playground. Some public facilities bear the word 'temporary' in their names because their 'land grants may not have been long term,' Deputy Director of Leisure and Cultural Services (Leisure Services) Ida Lee said. She added that if the land were to be handed to the government indefinitely, authorities would remove the word 'temporary.' 'Now that we are [talking about] changing the names of parks, logically, I am bringing this suggestion out for authorities to consider,' Ho said. In a paper submitted to LegCo, Ho listed 39 names grouped into four categories – historical national heroes, modern day national heroes, present day outstanding Chinese individuals, and outstanding local athletes. Among them were 12th century Song dynasty military general Yue Fei, Manchurian warlord Zhang Xueliang, martial artist Bruce Lee and medical expert Zhong Nanshan. 'There are tens of thousands of heroes and outstanding individuals in the whole of China,' Ho said. 'I think many of these names carry no controversy.' In the local athletes category, 14 people – including fencer Edgar Cheung, swimmer Siobhan Haughey and retired Paralympics star So Wa Wai – were named. Many of Hong Kong's roads and public facilities play tribute to the city's colonial past, named after British royalty or colonial political figures. Pro establishment figures have suggested erasing such symbols. In 2018, a member of Beijing's top advisory body said Hong Kong should 'undergo decolonisation' starting with changing place and street names. The government told lawmakers in a LegCo meeting after that it was unnecessary to review street names. 'Removing colonial government symbols is not a factor for consideration,' then development secretary Michael Wong said, citing the 'chaos and inconvenience' that may be caused by such changes. In the Tuesday meeting, lawmaker Priscilla Leung echoed Ho's comments that there were many figures in Chinese history worth honouring. 'In Chinese history, many have made major contributions to the nation, to society, to the world,' she said. Undersecretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Raistlin Lau Chun said Ho's 'intentions' were good, but that administratively, they would be difficult to implement. Authorities would only consider them for the naming of large parks or playgrounds, Lau added. Ho said the naming could consider the manner in which the city's typhoons are named, whereby there is a list of names and no need for public consultation.

The Hurun China Rich List, released Tuesday, said the total wealth of all individuals with a minimum net worth of 5 billion yuan (US$691 million) dropped by 18 percent to US$3.5 trillion. Only 1,305 people made it onto the list — an 11 percent net decrease compared with last year, and the biggest drop in 24 years. The fortunes of China's ultra rich have been battered by Beijing's harsh zero Covid policy, which has heavily disrupted production and supply chains. They have also taken a hit from stock market routs during a two year crackdown on the tech industry, and suffered from geopolitical volatility caused by events such as the war in Ukraine. The property and healthcare sectors were hit especially hard, according to the list. Property developer Yang Huiyan of Country Garden Holdings lost the most personal wealth at US$15.7 billion this year, while Pony Ma, founder of tech and gaming giant Tencent, lost US$14.6 billion after a sweeping crackdown on the gaming industry last year. China's three richest people stayed the same as last year, with Zhong Shanshan, founder of bottled water company Nongfu Spring, increasing his wealth by 17 percent to US$65 billion. Zhang Yiming, the founder of TikTok parent ByteDance, retained second place but saw his wealth drop by 28 percent to US$35 billion after the company's valuation dropped. Alibaba founder Jack Ma fell from fifth to ninth place after losing 29 percent of his wealth to US$25.7 billion, while Pony Ma slipped from fourth place to fifth. Nearly 300 individuals listed last year were absent from this year's list, most from the property industry, which has faced a spiralling debt crisis after the government imposed borrowing curbs in 2020. The chairman of property giant Evergrande, Xu Jiayin, fell out of the 100 richest to 172nd place as his company sagged under over US$300 billion of debt. The International Monetary Fund has predicted that China's annual GDP growth will only reach 3.2 percent this year.

However, Hongkongers who lined the Avenue of Stars in Tsim Sha Tsui were unable to see the occurrence because of thick cloud. Despite the stubborn cloud cover, dedicated photographers and astronomy enthusiasts positioned along the promenade hoped for a silver lining. The moon was supposed to have turned 'an uncommon coppery red hue,' according to the Hong Kong Space Museum, which live streamed the event. Lunar eclipses occur when the Earth comes between the sun and the full moon, blocking the sun's rays from reaching the moon. It is sometimes called a 'blood moon' because the moon appears red as it is illuminated by light from Earth's sunrises and sunsets. Derek Chan and Kenny Wong told HKFP they had taken annual leave to try and see the total lunar eclipse. 'It's alright if we don't see the blood moon tonight. We can wait for the next one,' Wong said. 'I heard it won't be until 2,000 year time, though,' Chan added. The next time a total lunar eclipse will be visible from Hong Kong will be on September 8, 2025. However, a total lunar eclipse will not occur with a lunar occultation of Uranus in the skies above Hong Kong until 4862.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/08/17-hong-kong-democrats-set-to-face-90-day-national-security-trial-in-early-2023-over-unofficial-primaries/;2022-11-08 21:01:00+08:00; 17 Hong Kong democrats set to face 90 day national security trial in early 2023 over unofficial primaries; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit Seventeen Hong Kong pro democracy figures who have pleaded not guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit subversion are expected to face a 90 day trial in early 2023, a court has heard. High Court judges Andrew Chan, Wilson Chan and Johnny Chan on Tuesday held a case management hearing for 17 defendants who are among 47 well known politicians and activists prosecuted under the Beijing imposed national security law over unofficial legislative primary elections held in July 2020. The designated national security judges demanded the prosecution file a detailed opening statement or a draft of the admitted facts, which would identify their allegations against individual defendants and the evidence they plan to rely on. The court wanted to know 'the case against each specific defendant,' judge Andrew Chan told lead prosecutor Andy Lo, including the acts, conduct and words uttered by the accused the prosecution deemed as relevant to the charge. 'You have been sitting on this case for ages,' the judge said. The 47 democrats were first brought to court in March last year, and most of them have been detained since after their bail applications were rejected on national security grounds following a four day marathon hearing. At present, only 13 defendants are on bail. The alleged conspiracy revolved around the primary polls, which aimed to help the pro democracy camp select candidates for an upcoming Legislative Council election and secure a majority in the legislature. The defendants were said to have intended, had they secured a majority, to abuse their powers as lawmakers to veto budget bills, paralyse government operations and eventually force the chief executive to resign. So far, 30 defendants have pleaded guilty and are awaiting mitigation and sentencing. It is not yet known whether that will happen before or after the trial of the 17 who denied the charge, which is also yet to be set. The request for more detailed accusations was also raised by the defence on Tuesday, after they said the items listed in a questionnaire prepared by the prosecutors were 'too broad or vague' for the accused to admit. Admitting to the items which contained 'hidden traps' would cause 'confusion or injustice' to his client, said barrister Cheung Yiu leung, who represented former district councillor Clarisse Yeung. While prosecutor Lo told the court that the facts they prepared could be agreed by the defendants, judge Andrew Chan cast doubt on such an anticipation. It would be a 'fantasy' for the prosecutors to think they could seek common ground with the defence with the existing list of facts, he said. 'Whatever endeavour you are going to pursue, the result would be fruitless,' the judge remarked. The democrats who denied the charge are set to stand trial before the three judge panel – rather than a jury –after the Lunar New Year in late January or early February next year. The whole trial was estimated to last for 91 working days, Lo said on Tuesday, with the hope of concluding the case that began more than 20 months ago in June or July next year. Around 55 days would be allocated to the prosecution to prove their case by calling upon 51 witnesses and presenting around 100 video clips – totalling 43 hours long – to show the election forums held and events attended by the accused, Lo said. The defence, on the other hand, would be given 36 days to challenge the allegations, with journalist turned activist Gwyneth Ho planning to call upon an expert witness in legislative and constitutional procedures. The plan came after Executive Council convenor and lawmaker Regina Ip was listed as a prosecution witness, Ho's barrister Trevor Beel told the court. Ip was summoned to testify in a closed door preliminary hearing requested by defendant Gordon Ng back in July, when Principal Magistrate Peter Law ruled that there was sufficient evidence to commit the activist for trial. The judges expressed concerns on Tuesday after Lo said the Department of Justice has yet to decide who would represent them at the trial. The choice of counsel would depend on the trial date, he said. The case was adjourned to Wednesday morning for the prosecutors to seek advice and decide on their representation. They are also expected to inform the court when the requested draft of admitted facts or opening statement could be ready. The court may still not be able to settle on a trial date, however, as judge Andrew Chan said some of the defendants who pleaded guilty have yet to admit to facts prepared by the prosecution. There is a possibility that more democrats will stand trial, he said. Tuesday's hearing was held in the West Kowloon Law Courts Building instead of the High Court in Admiralty, where the courtrooms are not large enough to accommodate dozens of legal representatives, family members and friends of the defendants, journalists and members of the public, including diplomats from various consulates.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/06/domestic-workers-who-fall-foul-of-hong-kongs-complex-covid-rules-dispute-hk10000-fines/;2022-11-06 10:00:00+08:00; 'I didn't know': Hong Kong's complex Covid 19 rules see domestic workers fined HK$10,000 for missing arrival tests; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit When Anna, a migrant domestic worker, landed in Hong Kong in May, she – like all arrivals to the city – completed a week of hotel quarantine per the Covid 19 rules at the time. Six days later, a friend told her she was required to have taken compulsory Covid 19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests at government centres after leaving her hotel. Anna went to take one immediately, but it was too late. In July, Department of Health officers turned up at her employer's home with a HK$10,000 fine for missing the tests – an amount more than double the minimum monthly salary for domestic workers. 'I didn't do the tests because I didn't know,' Anna, who asked to go by a nickname, told HKFP. 'My agency never said anything, and my employer also had no idea.' Anna is among dozens of domestic workers in Hong Kong who have been caught up in the city's byzantine and ever changing measures for overseas arrivals. When she arrived in May, travellers were required to take daily Covid 19 rapid tests and two PCR tests while in hotel quarantine, as well as further PCR tests on the ninth and 12th day of their arrival. For domestic workers, many of whom face a language barrier and – in some cases – are arriving in Hong Kong for the first time, the convoluted Covid 19 rules are only made more complicated, according to unions and NGOs that have been helping workers like Anna to appeal the fines. The Hong Kong Federation of Asian Domestic Workers Unions (FADWU) told HKFP it had helped 34 domestic workers dispute the penalties. After communicating with authorities, the Department of Health rescinded the fines for 33 cases, while one was still being investigated. NGO Mission for Migrant Workers said it was assisting a further 10 domestic workers who had been fined. Authorities had yet to reverse the penalties for most of them, although the fine was scrapped for one who had completed the tests but used inconsistent forms of identification – namely her passport and Hong Kong identity card – when registering. Upon being issued the penalty, the receiver is given three weeks to pay. FADWU told HKFP that many domestic workers who had tried to appeal their fines before approaching the union had not heard back from authorities. Responding to HKFP, the Department of Health said it had issued over 5,400 fixed penalty notices to 'inbound persons for contravention of compulsory testing notices' from the start of the year until the end of September. In total, 549 fines were dismissed in the same time period. It is unclear how many domestic workers were recipients of those fines. Information about testing requirements is on the government's websites. But the pages are wordy and difficult to navigate, said An An, the organising secretary of FADWU. Authorities also send text messages with reminders of testing dates depending on when an arrival landed, but the language is cumbersome and only in Chinese and English. 'The process is difficult for anyone who travels inbound, let alone migrant workers,' An An said. Some domestic workers did not receive the messages because they did not have Hong Kong phone numbers. In a pre departure health declaration form, they might have written a mobile number from their native country, while others put down their agency or employer's number, An An added. The declaration form does ask travellers to provide a Hong Kong mobile number or a 'non local mobile number that can receive international roaming SMS' to receive 'important SMS notifications' from the government, but activists say it is difficult for new domestic workers to do so. A domestic worker, who asked to be identified by her nickname Iche, told HKFP she arrived in Hong Kong for the first time in June and quarantined in a hotel for seven days. She did not have a chance to get a Hong Kong sim card because, as with all arrivals, she had to go straight to quarantine upon landing. 'My agency didn't tell me I needed a Hong Kong number,' Iche said. 'And the hotel [I quarantined at] didn't remind me about the compulsory testing.' The Department of Health did not respond to HKFP's question about whether it had alternative communication methods for arrivals who could not be contacted. Marites Palma, the founder of activist group Social Justice for Migrant Workers, said some employers had footed the fine for domestic workers and were deducting repayments from their salaries until they have paid it off. Hong Kong's domestic workers earn a minimum monthly salary of HK$4,730, an amount that was increased by HK$100 last month after being frozen since 2019. The fines, she said, aggravate the debt that many workers are in before they even begin their jobs. 'Many workers coming to Hong Kong already owe a lot of money to the agency because they have to pay a large amount before flying here,' Palma added. Different parties including workers' employment agencies, the Hong Kong government and the consulate offices of their home countries should do more to ensure that important messages reach domestic workers, unions and NGOs said. 'The agencies have to inform their employers, because otherwise they may not allow the workers to go out and take the compulsory tests,' Edwina Antonio Santoyo, a board member of the Mission for Migrant Workers, said. 'Or they may not understand the [consequence of missing] the tests.' An An of FADWU said the greatest responsibility lies with the government. She suggested that authorities set up information booths at the airport to inform domestic workers of the rules upon landing. 'The government should print out leaflets in minority languages and give them out at the airport,' she said. Asked how the government was addressing the language barrier faced by domestic workers, the Labour Department told HKFP it posted 'relevant information' on the 'FDH (Foreign Domestic Helpers) Portal,' a multi lingual section on the department's website that lists general information and updates relating to domestic workers in the city. In a four page reply to FADWU seen by HKFP, the Centre for Health Protection said when hotel quarantine was still required, hotels were tasked with distributing 'reminder notes to inbound travellers upon their discharge from the hotels' stating the dates they must undergo compulsory testing. The centre added that the note was 'translated into nine ethnic minority languages.' FADWU and Palma, however, said they were not aware of hotels passing out such notes. An An added that the cases FADWU had received were only the tip of the iceberg, saying it was possible that many domestic workers who received the fines did not have success while appealing and were unaware of where to turn for assistance. 'What we ask is for the government to drop all the fines against migrant domestic workers,' she said.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/05/lets-talk-about-sex-artist-claudia-chanhoi-on-genitals-shame-and-social-media-censorship/;2022-11-05 10:00:00+08:00; Let's talk about sex: Artist Claudia Chanhoi on genitals, shame and social media censorship; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit Claudia Chanhoi is used to being censored. After all, she makes Instagram unfriendly art. Her social media pages are peppered with breasts, bums, penises and vaginas, sometimes euphemistically presented, sometimes explicitly so, but always in a highly stylised aesthetic that favours bold colours and bolder lines. Suggestive subject matter is a Chanhoi signature, regardless of whether she is delving into the disposable nature of contemporary dating or discussing whether we can disassociate body parts from sexual content, and it frequently brings her into censors' line of fire. 'My work used to be censored and taken down from social media a lot because I often feature genitals in my art,' Chanhoi told HKFP. 'Even though I feel it's far from explicit  my work still got censored,' she continued, adding that it left her feeling 'confused' and 'a little bit attacked as a creative.' 'Why is my art shameful or offensive to others, while we see sexualised images of women pretty much everywhere?' Rather than bend to the puritanical will of Behance, Facebook and Instagram, Chanhoi doubled down. 'This is why I have been constantly doing lots of work with genitals or work about sexualisation, because to me, it was a bit like a protest,' she said. Her frank approach to sex and sexual organs is also rooted in rebellion. 'I grew up in a very conservative environment, because I was born Catholic and I also went to Catholic school,' Chanhoi said. 'I feel like the fact that I am so interested in talking about [sexuality] is just because I couldn't.' Born in Hong Kong, Chanhoi's career as an artist took off while she was at art school in Britain. 'Everything came from my university projects,' she said, which were largely focused on the sexual objectification of women. At the same time, she was learning about her area of study outside of the institution. 'I feel like I was constantly seen as a foreign object in the UK,' she said, adding that she has always felt safer in Hong Kong. 'People would cat call me and I would get a lot of comments on the way I look  and also being an Asian woman was  I wouldn't say a scary thing but I always felt like it was quite a dangerous body to be in.' London, Chanhoi said, has progressed since then. Her conservative hometown, however, has not. 'I feel like the world has changed a lot  in Hong Kong, we are still, let's say, 10 years behind.' Chanhoi has worked with Swedish sex toy brand Lelo, which surveyed Hongkongers' attitudes to sex and extras in 2021 and found that 52 per cent of respondents were not open to using sex toys, saying they believed them to be perverted or were afraid of how their partner may react. Despite believing Hong Kong to be buttoned up, Chanhoi said she was 'still quite surprised' to discover how many people held that opinion. 'In 2022  we see sexualised images all the time but when it comes to exploring our sexuality we're just so, I don't know, scared of it or ashamed of it,' Chanhoi said. 'Like it's taboo to talk about it – which it shouldn't be – because we see 'sex sells' everywhere. I just don't understand where that perspective comes from.' 'We're not supposed to be born with shame.' Chanhoi said she believed it was learned behaviour, perhaps from being told not to talk about our genitals as children or being encouraged to address sexual organs by alternative names. 'But then you begin to learn that there's something wrong with them, they must be something bad,' she said. 'This is how we learn that  some of our body parts can be shameful.' Chanhoi explores and subverts this sense of shame in her work, which puts genitals front and centre, always in a playful way. In one diptych pinned to the top of her Instagram page, a cartoonish clitoris appears alongside a pair of testes, a pubic area complete with pubic hair, an Adam's apple and hairy legs. In the caption, she asks: 'Can we start (de)sexualising [body parts] and look at them without shame and disgust?' Although allowed to remain on Instagram, the images were recently removed from Adobe's portfolio style platform Behance. 'They just said something like, nudity is not allowed,' Chanhoi said, her detached tone revealing how familiar she is with this response. 'You know, obviously  But there's no nudity. This is what my art is all about, right, playing around with [that] idea.' 'I am used to being censored so I like to add a little something to see if that will be censored.' On a more serious note, though, Chanhoi said she believed something was amiss in the way we see – or rather do not see – our sexual organs portrayed in the media. 'We can't really separate sexualisation and body parts. Because we associate them with something like porn, but it is not always like that,' she said. 'Lots of Instagrammers post pictures of them being super sexy and super sexualised, but once a genital is featured, it becomes like, 'oh my god, that's so unacceptable we should take it down or remove it',' Chanhoi continued. 'It's just really interesting that one tiny little genital could change so much when we pretty much see soft porn everywhere in the media, or TV shows.' After four years overseas, Chanhoi returned to Hong Kong – a city which, at least at first, was slow to catch on to her provocative style. 'I felt, at the time, people would not be happy with my work, especially in a place like Hong Kong,' she said. But 'that completely changed because of Apple Daily,' she said. In 2019, the pro democracy tabloid – which has since been forced to shutter after top executives were arrested under Hong Kong's national security law and its newsroom was raided by police – interviewed her. That interview 'changed the game completely,' Chanhoi said. 'Their audience was huge, crazily huge. I mean, to be honest, I was not really an Apple Daily reader, but it was so sad to see it shut down like that.' Overnight, Chanhoi said she started being approached by Hong Kong based clients, and found herself with new, Hong Kong based followers. Chanhoi left her job as a brand design manager earlier this year to dedicate herself to her art full time. Still, she said, she often hears that her work is 'a bit too much' or brands will ask her to 'not include the genitals,' while saying 'we still want you to draw something about sexuality.' Most often, the clients expressing such hesitations were those in Hong Kong, Chanhoi said, adding that most of her commissions came from overseas. 'It's just a little bit more conservative here when it comes to sexuality and body parts.' 'In Hong Kong, being an artist can be quite difficult,' she said, adding that she did not see Beijing's plan to position the city as a cultural hub helping emerging artists such as herself. 'Not personally and not professionally,' she answered when asked whether the opening of M+ and other planned museums might have a trickle down effect on the local art ecosystem. Regardless, Chanhoi is keeping busy. She will be speaking on genitals and taboos at the TEDxTinHauWomen event next month and has recently completed a 'really fun' project for a UK based client on the theme of sex and Christmas. 'Cute, sexy illustrations  like a reindeer with a gag,' she said.

According to Immigration Department statistics, Hong Kong saw 10.8 million arrivals in October 2019, but only 318,935 last month. On Tuesday, Hong Kong's John Lee said the city was 'full of life' since the hotel quarantine requirement was axed, adding that overall arrival numbers rose 1.6 times in October compared to September. Since September 26, arrivals no longer need to quarantine in a designated hotel. Instead, they undergo almost a dozen Covid 19 tests and three days of 'medical surveillance,' during which they can leave home but will be restricted from entering premises such as bars and restaurants. Hong Kong still enforces a group gathering limit of 12 in public, makes mask wearing compulsory, and requires tracing apps for entering certain premises such as restaurants. The city is hosting a FinTech event, a bankers' summit and the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens this week, as it seeks to demonstrate it is reopen for business. Since the onset of the pandemic, Hong Kong has seen 10,397 deaths and 1.91 million cases according to the government's Covid 19 dashboard on Tuesday.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/10/31/exclusive-university-of-hong-kong-makes-library-users-register-to-access-some-politically-sensitive-books/;2022-10-31 19:40:00+08:00; Exclusive: University of Hong Kong makes library users register to access some politically sensitive books;" Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit The library at Hong Kong's top university has introduced a new system under which readers must register in advance to gain access to some politically sensitive books or archive materials. A Hong Kong researcher said the new policy, which follows moves by the city's public libraries to remove some titles, might impede study of more 'sensitive' topics. The new system has been installed at the University of Hong Kong's (HKU) Special Collections, a space separated by a glass wall within the Main Library building. The area 'houses a unique collection of Hong Kong materials, rare books, and microforms,' according to HKU's website. The Special Collections section was closed from mid February till April for what the university described last December as being for 'Air Handling Unit and dehumidifier replacement.' The statement last December did not mention any changes to accessibility after the space reopened. On May 18, HKU announced a new booking system for reserving desks in the Special Collections area 'to enhance the user experience.' Patrons were required to register books which they wished to consult at the counter. Anyone who wishes to take a photo with their smartphone of a book must first fill out a form, specifying the details of the book and the number of photos to be taken. Previously, users of the Special Collections section did not have to make bookings in advance or register books they wished to consult. The university told HKFP the new booking arrangements were made 'to effectively protect and preserve the fragile and irreplaceable materials for future generations of scholars.' When HKFP visited the library last month, five politically sensitive books – either written by activists or dealing with the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown – were available only in the Special Collections section. The five titles included the English version of Joshua Wong's Unfree Speech: The Threat to Global Democracy and Why We Must Act, Now; Nathan Law's Freedom: How We Lose It and How We Fight Back; Chin Wan's On the Hong Kong City state; Mark Clifford's Today Hong Kong, Tomorrow the World: What China's Crackdown Reveals About Its Plan to End Freedom Everywhere, and a photobook by the now disbanded Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China. For three other books on the Tiananmen crackdown, including the Factual Account of a Search for the June 4 Victims by the leader of the Tiananmen Mothers Ding Zilin, readers had to request access online. Separately, the city's public libraries removed 29 out of 149 books about the Tiananmen crackdown from their shelves, a total of 263 individual copies, an HKFP investigation found last year. The university did not answer questions on how the library determines what books are to be made accessible only on request. In addition to contemporary political books, the Special Collections also hosts colonial records including government gazettes, and Hansards, with some of the materials digitalised by HKU and made available online to the public. A Hong Kong policy researcher, who requested anonymity, told HKFP the new arrangements may deter some from conducting research on more 'sensitive topics.' 'The library still records who borrowed what, and when, they even collect what copies the researchers made. The perception of being 'monitored' is still there, and it may deter researchers from pursuing certain sensitive topics,' the researcher said. While some books might still be on the shelves, 'researchers may have second thoughts on borrowing them.' The researcher described the new policy as 'disproportionate' since it covers the entire Special Collections, including non sensitive materials. 'It is definitely an unnecessary hindrance to the research community.' Apart from public libraries, some primary and secondary school libraries have removed books on topics ranging from introductions to the city's electoral system, to historical titles about the Cultural Revolution, Ming Pao reported. The Education Bureau in February last year published guidelines requiring schools to ensure that materials do not endanger national security. While HKU, like the seven other publicly funded universities in the city, has launched a compulsory national security course, books that are politically sensitive or censored in mainland China such as The People's Republic of Amnesia: Tiananmen Revisited by Louisa Lim, The Tiananmen Papers by Liang Zhang and a memoir by Ai Wei Wei, are still freely available in the university's main library, The Beijing imposed national security law, enacted in June 2020, criminalises subversion, secession, collusion with foreign forces and terrorist acts, which were broadly defined to include disruption to transport and other infrastructure. The move gave police sweeping new powers, alarming democrats, civil society groups and trade partners, as such laws have been used broadly to silence and punish dissidents in China. However, the authorities say it has restored stability and peace to the city.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/08/covid-19-hong-kong-to-exempt-amber-code-tour-group-arrivals-from-rules-can-visit-museums-designated-eateries/;2022-11-08 00:02:00+08:00; Covid 19: Hong Kong to exempt 'amber code' tour group arrivals from rules, can visit museums, 'designated' eateries; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit Hong Kong will soon exempt travellers in tour groups from Covid 19 rules that bar new arrivals from going to restaurants and other venues during the first three days of their visit. The government said in a statement on Monday that the new measures were announced 'under the principle of striking a balance between epidemic risks and the need for economic development.'Individuals, and those not in group tours, will still be subject to the usual rules. No timeline was given for the relaxation, but the government said the arrangements will be launched 'this month.' Currently, all inbound travellers to Hong Kong are assigned an amber code in their Vaccine Pass app for the first three days. This means they are not allowed to enter venues operating under the Vaccine Pass scheme, including restaurants, bars, gyms, salons and other businesses. Under the new arrangements, those entering Hong Kong in tour groups operated by 'licensed tourist guides' will be able to enter 'designated tourist attractions' including theme parks, museums and temples with an amber code in their Vaccine Pass. They will also be able to eat in the 'partitioned areas' of 'designated catering premises' that meet the government's requirements. The tour groups' travel agents must pre register trip itineraries with the Travel Industry Council, a group that regulates travel agents in Hong Kong. Authorities said they are also exploring the possibility of reducing the number of Covid 19 tests tour group travellers have to undergo fewer Covid 19 tests upon arrival. At the moment, arrivals must take four PCR tests – including one at the Hong Kong airport – and rapid tests every day for a week. While Hong Kong has dropped many of its strictest travel related Covid 19 measures in recent months, including a requirement for arrivals to quarantine in a hotel, the city still maintains rules that countries around the world have long abandoned. Businesses have expressed concern that the current '0+3' requirement is not enough to drive tourism as travellers cannot eat out and go to many attractions in their first three days. The government said plans to relax rules for travellers coming in with tour groups would move Hong Kong towards resuming normalcy and restarting tourism. 'The relevant arrangements can support the gradual resumption of the inbound travel market in an orderly manner, and provide a more favourable business environment for the travel trade,' authorities said in the statement. According to the government's Covid 19 dashboard, the city has seen 1.95 million cases and 10,475 deaths.

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/11/05/asia/hong-kong-reopen-finance-summit-rugby-sevens-intl-hnk/index.html;2022-11-05 19:48:00; Hong Kong says it's back open for business. Will the world buy it?;" At a glitzy finance summit in Hong Kong this week, the city's leader triumphantly told a room packed with top Wall Street executives that the Asian hub was back in business. 'The worst is behind us,' he declared. Two days later, tens of thousands of rugby fans descended on the city's largest stadium for the Hong Kong Sevens, its biggest (and usually booziest) annual sporting event, which had been suspended since 2019 due to political unrest, and, later, Covid 19. The two high profile international events sent a clear message: After almost three years of border closures, mandatory quarantines, and restrictions on businesses and social gatherings, Hong Kong was finally reopening. For much of the pandemic, the semi autonomous Chinese city maintained some of the region's most stringent restrictions, including one of the world's longest mandatory quarantines for international arrivals. With the economy tanking and concerns mounting that Hong Kong was being left behind as the world moved on, the government finally threw open the city's doors in September and ended formal quarantine to the relief of millions of people. 'We were, we are and we will remain one of the world's leading financial centers,' vowed Hong Kong leader John Lee at Wednesday's summit, attended by more than 200 investors from 20 countries. 'You can take that to the bank.' Speaking on Friday ahead of the kickoff of the Sevens, Hong Kong Rugby Union CEO Robbie McRobbie hailed the return of the tournament as a 'catalyst, watershed,' a symbol that 'Hong Kong is still a vibrant, resilient city.' But experts warn the push to revive Hong Kong, while welcome and long overdue, faces many challenges ahead. The past few years of isolation, which coincided with an ongoing political crackdown, have taken their toll, they said. Despite what Lee and other leaders insist, the Hong Kong that's reopening is not the same city the world knew before the pandemic – and the true impact of that change remains to be seen. Last year, as many destinations reopened to travelers and relaxed restrictions, Hong Kong appeared to be stuck in a different reality. Restaurants, bars and gyms were frequently forced to shutter or limit their hours. Residential buildings were placed under lockdown for days. At one point, public gatherings were capped at two people. And most residents didn't leave the city for years, unable or unwilling to spend up to three weeks in hotel quarantine at their own cost upon return. Businesses were hit hard. The Sevens tournament makes up 95% of the Hong Kong Rugby Union's revenue, so 'we've had three years of redundancies and cutbacks,' said McRobbie. Many disillusioned residents chose to leave permanently; this past year, the city recorded its steepest drop in population since records began in 1961. Companies, too, began eyeing other locations – most notably Singapore, Hong Kong's longtime regional rival. Hong Kong's U turn on quarantine is a sign Beijing still needs its gate to the West But Hong Kong authorities, eager to reopen the border with mainland China – which still shows no sign of easing its strict zero Covid policy that aims to stamp out infections – remained reluctant to loosen restrictions for fear cases would spike and close that door. Then, a severe outbreak fueled by the highly contagious Omicron variant at the start of the year put an end to Hong Kong's hope of maintaining zero daily cases. Under mounting public pressure, the government lifted flight bans with certain countries and shortened hotel quarantine in March – but these small concessions did little to lure people back. According to media reports in August, some Wall Street banks warned their executives would only attend Wednesday's finance summit if there was quarantine free travel – a widely speculated factor behind the government's ultimate decision to scrap quarantine. Finance leaders in the city breathed a sigh of relief at the news. 'We've been closed for too long,' said Sebastian Paredes, CEO of Singaporean bank DBS' Hong Kong operations. 'We are beginning to open up following the other parts of the world that have already opened up. And this is a tangible demonstration that Hong Kong is back.' Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia Pacific Economist of French investment bank Natixis, agreed the week's dual big events were 'a big sign of Hong Kong moving away from Covid restrictions to a new world.' However, the remaining restrictions pose a competitive disadvantage. International visitors must take Covid tests for seven straight days after arrival in Hong Kong, and for the first three days are barred from restaurants, bars and gyms. But the testing doesn't stop there – bars and clubs that don't serve food require proof of a negative rapid antigen test from all patrons. A mask mandate – indoors and outdoors – is also in effect, though photos of the finance summit show attendees sitting at tables without face coverings. They included the city's Financial Secretary Paul Chan, who was declared a 'recovered case' by health authorities after testing positive for Covid upon arrival from a trip abroad on Tuesday. These rules are 'still largely prohibiting the overseas travel market,' said McRobbie, the Hong Kong rugby chief. Before the pandemic, roughly half the fans at the Sevens came from abroad; this year, that number is 'negligible,' he said. The long stretch of isolation and financial hardship has also created challenges for companies hoping for a comeback. Many people have left the sports and events sectors in the past few years in favor of more stable jobs, leaving the industry short staffed, McRobbie added. This partial reopening has left the city in an awkward Covid limbo, said Vera Yuen, an economics lecturer at the University of Hong Kong. 'If we want to open up our border with the Mainland China, our restriction is too lenient   so it's not allowed,' she said. 'But then if we want to open ourselves up to the world, we are still too stringent. We are now stuck in between, hoping to see better policies in the future.' Others also warn of growing political challenges. 'Clouds are certainly coming to Hong Kong from different angles,' said banker Garcia Herrero, pointing to the West's response to the sweeping national security law Beijing imposed on Hong Kong in 2020. Under this law, pro democracy activists have been jailed or exiled, independent newsrooms shut down, and former lawmakers targeted. Meanwhile, authorities have changed school curricula to emphasize Chinese history and culture, and pushed greater economic cooperation in the Greater Bay Area, a national scheme to link China's southern Guangdong province closer with Hong Kong and Macao. The law has been widely criticized by foreign governments and human rights organizations, with the United States sanctioning Lee and other top Hong Kong officials over their role in the crackdown. Hong Kong authorities have repeatedly claimed the law has restored order and stability after the city's 2019 anti government, pro democracy protests. For the US and the European Union, the national security law and crackdown represent 'a change in the rules of the game in what was agreed upon,' said Garcia Herrero. Xi Jinping brought Hong Kong to heel. Now he's back in a city transformed These rising tensions could spell trouble for Hong Kong's trade and diplomatic relationships with other countries. Hong Kong is afforded more freedoms than other Chinese cities, thus has long been seen as a gateway between the mainland and the West – a position that looks increasingly precarious as its civil liberties erode. 'The West would now understand that Hong Kong is not only part of China, but it's closer to China than before,' said Yuen, the economics lecturer. 'The worst scenario is that the West would treat Hong Kong as the same as the mainland China, and then Hong Kong would suffer the kind of sanctions.' And this drawing closer together is likely to continue. In an effort to stem the brain drain, the government is spending 30 billion Hong Kong dollars ($3.8 billion) to draw in global businesses and fresh talent – which Yuen said is expected to 'attract a lot of mainland workers' who may be eager to escape an even more dire job market across the border. Despite these geopolitical frictions, some argue Hong Kong's innate advantages will allow a revival – even if the city is heading in a different direction than before. Asia doesn't have many other financial centers that can match Hong Kong's open regulatory environment, low salaries tax and existing financial infrastructure – 'therefore, even if the image may be tarnished a little bit, there are not many other places to go,' said Garcia Herrero. Yuen echoed this point, saying the city's proximity to China remains appealing to businesses and investors hoping to tap into the vast and lucrative mainland market. 'We can plug into China and sort of maintain the status as having a little bit of autonomy, and (being) different from them, given different Covid policies and (systems of) governance,' she said. But, both experts acknowledged, the path forward is now fraught with new risks. International businesses may come to Hong Kong, but be warier in how much they invest in the city, keeping in mind the threat of US sanctions and regional conflict. Today's Hong Kong is increasingly under Beijing's control, with China growing more assertive on the world stage as leader Xi Jinping enters a third term in power surrounded by loyalists. Those rising tensions between China and its rivals have caused growing divides 'as the world deglobalizes,' said Garcia Herrero – effects that inevitably spill over into Hong Kong, caught in the middle. 'It will never be, in my opinion, what it used to be in terms of the openness of Hong Kong to both the West and the East,' she said.

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/11/04/investing/china-hong-kong-stocks/index.html;2022-11-04 08:41:00; Stocks in Hong Kong log best week in more than a decade;" Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Global investors have two big questions on their minds: When will the Federal Reserve become less aggressive in its campaign against inflation? And does Beijing plan to ease its strict 'zero Covid' policy any time soon? Markets were disappointed this week when the Fed indicated it could push interest rates even higher than previously expected, weighing on stocks in the United States and Europe. But in Asia, investors have been getting excited over speculation that coronavirus restrictions in China could be eased. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index

(HSI) soared more than 5% on Friday and finished the week up 8.7%, logging its biggest gain since 2011. China's Shanghai Composite

(SHCOMP) rose 5.3% this week, its best performance in more than two years. The rallies followed steep sell offs in the wake of China's Communist Party Congress last month. Investors were disappointed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping did not unveil stronger measures to combat a sharp economic slowdown. He also offered no signs the country would move away from its rigid approach to containing the spread of Covid 19, which has choked off growth. In recent days, lockdowns have caused significant disruption for Apple

(AAPL) supplier Foxconn and Disney

(DIS), as well as car makers and fast food restaurants. David Chao, global market strategist for Invesco Asia Pacific, said some of this investor angst appears to have lifted. 'There is so much pessimism and negativity surrounding China, surrounding Chinese growth, and I think a lot of that has already been discounted,' Chao said. Getting past the party congress has eliminated a key source of uncertainty, he added. Social media chatter that China could reopen its border with Hong Kong soon fed market optimism on Friday, as did a report from Bloomberg that US auditors had finished an inspection of Chinese firms ahead of schedule. The Hang Seng shot up 5.4%, while the Shanghai Composite gained 2.4%. Health officials in China have scheduled a press conference for Saturday amid growing frustration and resentment toward zero Covid rules and resulting lockdowns. 'The risk, of course, is there could be some disappointment here,' said Mitul Kotecha, head of emerging market strategy at TD Securities, speaking of the potential for looser coronavirus restrictions. 'There's only rumors and speculation at the moment.' Stocks in China and Hong Kong have been battered this year as investors have weighed darkening prospects for China's economy. The country, a crucial engine of global growth, has been slammed by a crisis in its real estate sector. At the same time, Beijing's Covid approach continues to hurt businesses and crimp consumer spending. The International Monetary Fund estimates that China's economy will expand by just 3.2% in 2022 and 4.4% in 2023, a big decline from the 8.1% growth it notched in 2021. The Hang Seng has plummeted 31% year to date, compared to a 22% drop in the S&P 500. The Shanghai Composite is 16% lower in 2022. Chao said investors have had to contend with the notion that China could grow much more slowly as it tries to reduce its reliance on debt and as investment declines in the real estate sector, which has recently accounted for as much as 30% of gross domestic product. 'We're not going to see that type of investment led economic growth over the next 10 years,' Chao said. But, he emphasized, that's not necessarily a bad thing, as growth starts to look more sustainable. And even if China's economy is growing just 3% or 4%, that will look much better than Europe and the United States, which are at risk of recession. 'From what I see, it's apparent to me that there is capital on the sidelines,' Chao said. 'There are investors waiting to jump back in to the China story.' — Steven Jiang contributed reporting.

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/11/02/business/hong-kong-finance-summit-john-lee-intl-hnk/index.html;2022-11-02 08:39:00; 'The worst is behind us': Hong Kong hosts top global bankers for finance summit;" Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hong Kong leader John Lee sought to drum up confidence in the city's future as a global financial hub on Wednesday, as he welcomed some of Wall Street's top executives to its biggest international event in years. Speaking at an investment summit that has attracted more than 200 participants from 20 countries, the city's chief executive said that it was 'opening once again' for international business after more than two and a half years of arduous pandemic restrictions. As he addressed some of the executives in attendance, including Goldman Sachs

(GS) CEO David Solomon, Morgan Stanley

(MS) CEO James Gorman, UBS

(UBS) chairman Colm Kelleher, HSBC

(HSBC) CEO Noel Quinn and Standard Chartered

(SCBFF) CEO Bill Winters, the government leader was insistent in reaffirming his intention to keep the former British colony competitive for global finance. 'We were, we are and we will remain one of the world's leading financial centers,' Lee vowed. 'You can take that to the bank.' From Apple to Disney, China's Covid curbs are again hurting business Lee also sought to reassure executives that Hong Kong would maintain a distinct role to that of mainland China, saying that central government officials had outlined their support for the city retaining its unique position as a gateway between East and West. China's latest five year plan includes goals to reinforce the city's role as an international trade, financial, shipping and aviation center, Lee said. 'The worst is behind us.' Solomon, Gorman and Kelleher, who took to the stage for a panel shortly after Lee's remarks, did not comment directly on the city's reopening. But Kelleher noted that 'whilst we're all very pro China,' the bank was 'waiting for zero Covid to open up in China and see what will happen.' In September, Hong Kong lifted quarantine requirements that had largely isolated the city, choked economic activity, and fueled a historic brain drain. Mainland China, however, still has a mandate in place for most inbound travelers to self isolate for at least seven days, under its stringent 'zero Covid policy.' That contrast was highlighted Wednesday as mainland Chinese officials — including People's Bank of China Governor Yi Gang — addressed the conference in pre recorded video remarks, rather than attending in person. America's top bankers are more worried about the state of the world than recession Hong Kong's economy is heavily reliant on financial services. In 2020, the sector contributed $76 billion — approximately 23% of its GDP, Lee said. In an interview with CNN Business, DBS Hong Kong CEO Sebastian Paredes called the show of support from the city's top brass 'a tangible demonstration that Hong Kong is back.' 'The people that have flown into Hong Kong — the global CEOs of insurance firms and private equity companies and banks and the rest — demonstrate that Hong Kong is a very important international financial center,' he said. 'We've been closed for too long,' he added, noting that some restrictions remain, including controls on the border with mainland China. 'But as we progress, at least we are opening internationally,' said Paredes. 'We are hopeful.' Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/10/25/investing/china-yuan-all-time-low-xi-jinping-third-term-intl-hnk/index.html;2022-10-25 04:44:00; China's yuan tumbles amid fears about Xi's third term;" Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News China's yuan tumbled on Tuesday to its lowest level in nearly 15 years on Tuesday as investors fled Chinese assets amid fears about Xi Jinping's dramatic move to tighten his grip on power in a major reshuffle of Communist Party leaders On the tightly controlled domestic market, the yuan dropped sharply, hitting the weakest level since late 2007. It was last down 0.6% at around 7.3 per dollar. The currency has lost 15% against the US dollar this year. In trading outside of mainland China, the yuan briefly plunged to around 7.36 per dollar early Tuesday, the lowest level on record, according to Refinitiv, which has data going back to 2010. It later pared losses, trading at 7.33 by 3:35 p.m. Hong Kong time (3.35 a.m. ET). The currency was pegged at 8.28 to the US dollar for years until 2005 when China moved to a 'managed floating exchange rate.' It then appreciated steadily, climbing to a peak of nearly 6.01 in 2014. Hong Kong stocks plunge 6% as fears about Xi's third term trump China GDP data The declines came alongside a historic market rout for Chinese assets worldwide. On Monday, Chinese stocks plummeted in Hong Kong and New York, wiping out billions of dollars in market value. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng

(HSI) Index closed down 6.4%. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index, which tracks many popular Chinese companies listed on Wall Street,dived more than 14%. On Tuesday, the Hang Seng

(HSI) slipped further and was down 0.2% in afternoon trading. The huge sell offs came just days after the ruling Communist Party unveiled its new leadership for the next five years. In addition to securing an unprecedented third term as party chief, Xi packed key positions with staunch loyalists. A number of senior officials who have backed market reforms and opening up the economy were missing from the new top team, stirring concerns about the future direction of the country and its relations with the United States. International investors spooked by the outcome of the leadership reshuffle dumped Chinese assets despite the release of stronger than expected Chinese GDP data on Monday. They're worried that Xi's tightening grip on power will lead to the continuation of Beijing's existing policies and further dent the economy, which despite the rebound last quarter is still growing way below the official 5.5% target for this year. China's leadership reshuffle 'sparked worries about the continuation of market unfavourable policies and increasing risk of policy mistakes under President Xi's power domination in coming years,' said Ken Cheung, chief Asian forex strategist at Mizuho Bank. 'Foreign investors took action to cut their exposure on Chinese assets,' he said, adding that the Chinese currency was faced with mounting capital outflow pressure. The Chinese yuan, together with other major global currencies, has weakened rapidly against the dollar in recent months. The greenback has surged to the highest level in two decades against a basket of major counterparts, boosted by a hawkish Fed that attempts to contain runaway inflation. The yuan is on track to log its worst year since 1994 — when China devalued its currency by 33% overnight as part of market reforms. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/10/23/economy/china-gdp-released-xi-third-term-stock-market-intl-hnk/index.html;2022-10-25 03:12:00; Hong Kong stocks plunge 6% as fears about Xi's third term trump China GDP data;" Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hong Kong stocks had their worst day since the 2008 global financial crisis, just a day after Chinese leader Xi Jinping secured his iron grip on power at a major political gathering. Foreign investors spooked by the outcome of the Communist Party's leadership reshuffle dumped Chinese equities and the yuan despite the release of stronger than expected GDP data. They're worried that Xi's tightening grip on power will lead to the continuation of Beijing's existing policies and further dent the economy. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng

(HSI) Index plunged 6.4% on Monday, marking its biggest daily drop since November 2008. The index closed at its lowest level since April 2009. The Chinese yuan weakened sharply, hitting a fresh 14 year low against the US dollar on the onshore market. On the offshore market, where it can trade more freely, the currency tumbled 0.8%, hovering near its weakest level on record, even as the Chinese economy grew 3.9% in the third quarter from a year ago, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Economists polled by Reuters had expected growth of 3.4%. The sharp sell off came one day after the ruling Communist Party unveiled its new leadership for the next five years. In addition to securing an unprecedented third term as party chief, Xi packed his new leadership team with staunch loyalists. A number of senior officials who have backed market reforms and opening up the economy were missing from the new top team, stirring concerns about the future direction of the country and its relations with the United States. Those pushed aside included Premier Li Keqiang, Vice Premier Liu He, and central bank governor Yi Gang. 'It appears that the leadership reshuffle spooked foreign investors to offload their Chinese investment, sparking heavy sell offs in Hong Kong listed Chinese equities,' said Ken Cheung, chief Asian forex strategist at Mizuho bank. The GDP data marked a pick up from the 0.4% increase in the second quarter, when China's economy was battered by widespread Covid lockdowns. Shanghai, the nation's financial center and a key global trade hub, was shut down for two months in April and May. But the growth rate was still below the annual official target that the government set earlier this year. 'The outlook remains gloomy,' said Julian Evans Pritchard, senior China economist for Capital Economics, in a research report on Monday. Xi Jinping enters third term as China's most powerful leader in decades surrounded by loyalists 'There is no prospect of China lifting its zero Covid policy in the near future, and we don't expect any meaningful relaxation before 2024,' he added. Coupled with a further weakening in the global economy and a persistent slump in China's real estate, all the headwinds will continue to pressure the Chinese economy, he said. Evans Pritchard expected China's official GDP to grow by only 2.5% this year and by 3.5% in 2023. Monday's GDP data were initially scheduled for release on October 18 during the Chinese Communist Party's congress, but were postponed without explanation. The possibility that policies such as zero Covid, which has resulted in sweeping lockdowns to contain the virus, and 'Common Prosperity' — Xi's bid to redistribute wealth — could be escalated was causing concern, Cheung said. 'With the Politburo Standing Committee composed of President Xi's close allies, market participants read the implications as President Xi's power consolidation and the policy continuation,' he added. Mitul Kotecha, head of emerging markets strategy at TD Securities, also pointed out that the disappearance of pro reform officials from the new leadership bodes ill for the future of China's private sector. Xi Jinping's speech: yes to zero Covid, no to market reforms? 'The departure of perceived pro stimulus officials and reformers from the Politburo Standing Committee and replacement with allies of Xi, suggests that 'Common Prosperity' will be the overriding push of officials,' Kotecha said. Under the banner of the 'Common Prosperity' campaign, Beijing launched a sweeping crackdown on the country's private enterprise, which shook almost every industry to its core. 'The [market] reaction in our view is consistent with the reduced prospects of significant stimulus or changes to zero Covid policy. Overall, prospects of a re acceleration of growth are limited,' Kotecha said. On the tightly controlled domestic market in China, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index dropped 2%. The tech heavy Shenzhen Component Index lost 2.1%. The Hang Seng Tech Index, which tracks the 30 largest technology firms listed in Hong Kong, plunged 9.7%. Shares of Alibaba

(BABA) and Tencent

(TCEHY) — the crown jewels of China's technology sector — both plummeted more than 11%, wiping a combined $54 billion off their stock market value. The sell off spilled over into the United States as well. Shares of Alibaba and several other leading Chinese stocks trading in New York, such as EV companies Nio

(NIO) and Xpeng, Alibaba rivals JD.com

(JD) and Pinduoduo

(PDD) and search engine Baidu

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/10/20/asia/russian-oligarch-luxury-yacht-departs-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html;2022-10-21 04:55:00; Sanctioned Russian oligarch's $500 million superyacht leaves Hong Kong for Cape Town; A luxury yacht belonging to sanctioned Russian oligarch Alexey Mordashov departed Hong Kong waters on Thursday heading for the South African port of Cape Town, according to private tracking site MarineTraffic. The prominent sight of the 465 foot (141 meter) multi deck Nord in the city's Victoria harbor in recent weeks had sparked criticism from the US State Department, which questioned the 'transparency' of the financial hub and warned of reputational risks. Mordashov, a billionaire close to President Vladimir Putin, was among a number of Russians sanctioned by the United States and European Union – but not the United Nations – after Russia's invasion of Ukraine for their links to Putin. While a number of Russian superyachts have been seized or denied entry in Europe and other jurisdictions, the Nord was left undisturbed in Hong Kong after its arrival on Oct. 5. Superyacht linked to Russian billionaire mysteriously shows up in Hong Kong Valued at over $500 million, it arrived via a seven day voyage from Vladivostok in Russian Far East, down through the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea. The Hong Kong Marine Department later confirmed that the Nord had departed Hong Kong on Thursday but said it could not comment further. The MarineTraffic site put the vessel southeast of Hong Kong waters early on Thursday evening, heading into the South China Sea. A witness saw a fuel barge alongside the vessel inside the harbor at noon. Hong Kong's leader John Lee said on Oct. 11 the city's authorities would not act on unilateral sanctions imposed on Mordashov by individual jurisdictions. 'We cannot do anything that has no legal basis,' said Lee, who himself has been sanctioned by the US for his role on a crackdown on local freedoms. Lee, who is due to host an international investment summit in November with global business leaders, said the Chinese ruled city would only abide by United Nations sanctions. © 2022 Cable News Network.

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/10/20/uk/manchester-chinese-consulate-hong-kong-protester-intl-hnk/index.html;2022-10-21 02:35:00; Chinese diplomat says pulling hair of Hong Kong protester was his 'duty'; A Chinese diplomat who was filmed pulling the hair of a Hong Kong pro democracy protester on the grounds of his consulate in Manchester, England, has defended his actions – saying it was his 'duty' to maintain China's dignity. 'Any diplomat' would have done the same, Chinese Consul General Zheng Xiyuan said on Wednesday when asked about video footage that has emerged of a group of men assaulting the protester. The confrontation took place on Sunday, when a group of pro democracy protesters turned up to the consulate with banners featuring satirical images of Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The demonstration coincided with the start of a key week long meeting of the Chinese Communist Party elites in Beijing, at which Xi is widely expected to secure a norm breaking third term as leader. Video footage shows one of the pro democracy protesters – since identified as Bob Chan – being dragged through the gate into the consulate grounds and being beaten by the group of men. It also shows Manchester police entering the consulate grounds to break up the violence. In an interview with Sky News on Wednesday, Zheng defended his actions and those of his staff, claiming the pro democracy protesters had incited the violence with 'rude banners.' 'I didn't beat anybody. I didn't let my people beat anybody. The fact is, the so called protesters beat my people,' Zheng said. However, when the Sky News interviewer asked about an image showing him pulling Chan's hair, Zheng seemed to concede he had been involved, saying: 'Yeah, the man abused my country, my leader. I think it's my duty.' 'To pull his hair?' the interviewer asked – to which Zheng responded, 'Yeah!' He added that he was maintaining the dignity of China and its people, and that 'any diplomat' would have done the same in such a situation. In a letter to Manchester police on Thursday, Zheng insisted the consulate had been 'respectful of the right to protest,' and claimed that the consular grounds had been 'stormed' by protesters. China's Foreign Ministry has been quick to defend Zheng, describing the protesters as 'harassers' who had illegally entered the Chinese consulate, 'endangering the security of Chinese diplomatic premises.' The incident now threatens to further damage UK China relations, which have soured in recent years with disagreements over Hong Kong, a former British colony, a major point of contention. On Tuesday, Britain's foreign secretary summoned China's second most senior diplomat in the UK, Charge D'Affaires Yang Xiaoguang, to demand an explanation and express deep concern at the incident. Manchester police have launched an investigation into the assault, but said on Wednesday that there had been no arrests so far, calling it a 'complex and sensitive inquiry' that will take time. Speaking publicly at a news conference Wednesday, Bob Chan said he now feared for his safety, and that of his family – echoing fears voiced by other members of Britain's Hong Kong diaspora. He claimed he had been trying to stop consular staff from ripping down protest banners when they began to assault him. 'I held onto the gate where I was kicked and punched. I could not hold on for long and was eventually pulled into the grounds of the consulate,' Chan said. 'My hair was pulled and I felt punches and kicks from several men,' he said, adding the assault did not stop until a police officer pulled him back out through the consulate gate. He showed photos of his injuries, saying he had bruises on his head, neck, back and around his eye. 'I fear I may be silenced by the powers that be. I fear for the safety of my family,' he continued. 'I'm shocked because I never thought something like this could happen in the UK.' Britain is home to a large number of Hong Kongers, many of whom left the city after Beijing introduced a sweeping national security law in 2020. Under the law, protesters and activists have been jailed, newsrooms shut, civic society dismantled and formal political opposition effectively wiped out. Hong Kong leaders have repeatedly claimed that the city's freedoms remain intact, and that the law has restored order and stability after massive pro democracy protests in 2019. But the combination of China's tightening grip on the city and its stringent Covid 19 restrictions have prompted an exodus from the city in recent years. In August, Hong Kong logged its biggest population drop since official records began in 1961. As the size of the Hong Kong diaspora has grown, and Beijing has become more assertive on the world stage, the UK China relationship has also deteriorated – with British public sentiment souring as well, experts say. 'The Manchester incident reflected the hardening of UK attitudes toward China since the 2019 protests in Hong Kong and the resultant cooling of UK China relations,' said Chi kwan Mark, a senior lecturer in international history at the University of London, adding that it partly reflected 'the intensified ideological clash between China and the West.' And it has become a bipartisan issue, with members of both Britain's Conservative and Labour parties supporting 'a hard line approach to China,' he said. In remarks to the UK's House of Commons on Tuesday, Conservative lawmaker Alicia Kearns called the incident 'a chilling escalation,' a sentiment echoed by Labour lawmaker Afzal Khan, who said: 'The aggressive, intimidating tactics of the Chinese Communist Party have no place on the streets of my city or my country.' 'The British government   is under pressure to do something concerning China, and to stand up for Hong Kong,' Mark said – though he added that those authorities are now in the difficult position of having to 'strike a balance between confrontation and engagement with China.' © 2022 Cable News Network.

The plunge comes at a time when members of China's ruling Communist Party are meeting for the 20th Party Congress, a major leadership reshuffle that sets the tone for policy for the coming years. In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng

(HSI) Index tumbled as much as 3% in Thursday's morning trade. By early afternoon, it pared losses to 1.1%, on track to hit its lowest close since October 2011, according to Refinitiv. The fall comes just a day after the city's leader, Chief Executive John Lee, promised to invest billions of dollars to bring global talent and businesses back to Hong Kong. The index was mainly dragged down by Chinese technology companies. Alibaba

(BABA)'s Hong Kong listed shares fell nearly 3%. Tencent

(TCEHY) also lost 2.9%. Baidu

(BIDU) sank more than 7%. The heavy decline followed a sharp sell off in Chinese stocks listed on Wall Street overnight. Xi Jinping's speech: yes to zero Covid, no to market reforms? The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index slid 7.1% on Wednesday to close at its lowest level since July 2013. JD.com

(JD) lost 7.7%. Alibaba's New York traded stock dropped 6.6%. US stocks closed lower on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.3%. The S&P 500 was down 0.6%, and the Nasdaq slid 0.9%. Other Asian markets also fell on Thursday. Japan's nikkei 22

(N225)5 dropped 0.9%, while the Japanese yen hit a fresh 32 year low against the dollar. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.8%. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 1.1%. But China's Shanghai Composite Index reversed earlier losses and edged up 0.3%. Analysts are concerned about China's growth outlook after Xi Jinping's opening speech at the 20th party congress. The Chinese leader offered no signs of moving away from the country's rigid zero Covid policy or its tight regulatory stance on various businesses, both of which have hampered growth in the world's second largest economy. Xi is expected to secure an unprecedented third term in power at the week long congress. 'China's National Party Congress failed to drive a positive catalyst, ' said Yeap Jun Rong, a market strategist for IG Group, on Thursday. He added that investors are also concerned that rising Covid cases in Beijing may lead to 'aggressive restriction measures.' China's capital detected 41 Covid cases on Tuesday, the most in four months, according to the city's health commission. The country delayed the released of its third quarter GDP data on Tuesday, which has stoked further worries. 'China's decision to delay the release of key economic readings could suggest the data is so ugly that they don't want it released during the party's congress,' said Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the Americas at Oanda, in a research note on Wednesday.

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/10/19/business/hong-kong-business-investment-covid-reopening-intl-hnk/index.html;2022-10-19 03:18:00; Facing brain drain, Hong Kong plans $3.8 billion 'trawl' for global talent;" Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hong Kong wants international firms to know it means business. The city's leader, Chief Executive John Lee, announced Wednesday that the government would earmark 30 billion Hong Kong dollars ($3.8 billion) for a new fund aimed at bringing more businesses in. The fund will seek to attract companies to set up operations in Hong Kong, as well as invest in their businesses, he said in a wide ranging policy address. The move comes after the city witnessed a massive exodus amid some of the world's strictest pandemic controls, which were recently eased after more than two years. In August, Hong Kong logged its biggest population drop since officials began keeping track of such figures in 1961. Lee addressed the record decline on Wednesday, noting: 'Over the past two years, the local workforce shrank by about 140,000.' 'Apart from actively nurturing and retaining local talents, the government will proactively trawl the world for talents,' the chief executive added. Lee also announced Wednesday the launch of an initiative aimed at attracting more workers, including select high earners and graduates from the world's top 100 universities. Eligible candidates 'will be issued a two year pass for exploring opportunities in Hong Kong,' he said. That should come as welcome relief for businesses in Hong Kong, which had long warned of a brain drain. Before the recent removal of quarantine measures, many workers had expressed frustration over the city's onerous travel restrictions, which at one point required up to 21 days of hotel quarantine. The measures damaged the city's economy, and led many multinational companies and expatriates to shift — or consider moving — elsewhere. Hong Kong is the Asian base for many multinational companies, including top banks and financial firms. The former British colony has traditionally been seen as a friendly international gateway to mainland China. In recent years, its reputation for openness and ease of doing business have fallen, while rival hub Singapore raced ahead. Hong Kong is working to change that perception, by stepping up efforts to rebuild its status as a global business and financial hub. Next month, the city's officials will welcome some of Wall Street's top executives for a long awaited financial summit. Goldman Sachs

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/10/17/uk/manchester-chinese-consulate-protesters-intl-hnk/index.html;2022-10-18 05:00:00; Hong Kong protester allegedly beaten at Chinese consulate in UK; Police in Manchester have launched an investigation after a Hong Kong pro democracy protester was allegedly beaten on the grounds of the Chinese consulate in the English city. A pro democracy group called Hong Kong Indigenous Defence Force had staged a protest outside the consulate in the northern city on Sunday, in opposition to the Chinese Communist Party Congress happening the same day in Beijing. Video of the incident shared widely on social media shows a confrontation breaking out on the sidewalk outside the consulate, with loud shouts heard as people rush towards the gated entrance. The video then appears to show one Hong Kong protester being dragged through the gate into the consulate grounds and beaten by a group of men. The video appears to show local police entering the grounds of the consulate to break up the violence. Hong Kong Indigenous Defence Force alleges that Chinese consular staff were involved in the alleged beating, and that the protester was taken to hospital in stable condition. Greater Manchester Police said Monday they were investigating the incident, in which a man 'suffered several physical injuries.' 'We understand the shock and concern that this incident will have caused not just locally, but for those much further afield who may have connections with our communities here in Greater Manchester,' assistant chief constable Rob Potts said in a statement. 'Shortly before 4 p.m. a small group of men came out of the building and a man was dragged into the Consulate grounds and assaulted. Due to our fears for the safety of the man, officers intervened and removed the victim from the Consulate grounds.' 'The man – aged in his 30s – suffered several physical injuries and remained in hospital overnight for treatment. He is continuing to receive our support for his welfare.' The statemented added that currently 'no arrests have been made' and that the investigation was ongoing. A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Liz Truss described the incident as 'deeply concerning.' On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said he was 'not aware of the situation.' 'Chinese Embassy and consulates in the UK have always abided by the laws of the countries where they are stationed,' he said in a regular news briefing. 'We also hope that the British side, in accordance with the provisions of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, will facilitate the normal performance of the duties of the Chinese Embassy and consulates in the UK.' CNN approached the Chinese Embassy in London for comment but did not receive an immediate response. Video of the scuffle has been shared online by multiple UK lawmakers, who have called for an investigation into the alleged involvement of Chinese consular staff. 'The UK Government must demand a full apology from the Chinese Ambassador to the UK and demand those responsible are sent home to China,' ruling Conservative Party lawmaker Iain Duncan Smith wrote on Twitter. Conservative Party member of Parliament Alicia Kearns also tweeted on Sunday that authorities 'need to urgently investigate,' and that the Chinese Ambassador should be summoned. 'If any official has beaten protesters, they must be expelled or prosecuted,' she wrote. Both lawmakers have previously been vocal critics of the Chinese Communist Party. Prominent Hong Kong activists have also spoken out. Nathan Law, a former lawmaker and pro democracy figure who fled to the UK in 2020, tweeted: 'If the consulate staff responsible are not held accountable, Hong Kongers would live in fear of being kidnapped and persecuted.' He urged the British government to 'investigate and protect our community and people in the UK.' Britain is home to large numbers of Hong Kong citizens, many of whom left the territory following the introduction of a sweeping national security law in 2020 that critics say stripped the former British colony of its autonomy and precious civil freedoms, while cementing Beijing's authoritarian rule. According to an online statement by organizers of Sunday's protest, around 60 demonstrators had gathered outside the Manchester consulate to protest 'the re election of Xi Jinping.' The Chinese Communist Party Congress, a twice a decade leadership reshuffle and meeting of the party's top officials, kicked off on Sunday. Chinese leader Xi, who came to power in 2012, is widely expected to break with convention and take on a third term, paving the way for lifelong rule. © 2022 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.
