File photo: RTHK A former engineer was on Thursday jailed for five years after he admitted to stabbing a police officer during a riot in Causeway Bay two years ago.

District Court judge Frankie Yiu said Wong Kwan-wa was among 300 people who took part in a protest, which turned into a 10-minute riot, on July 1, 2020, less than 24 hours after the national security law took effect in Hong Kong.

The court heard that Wong, 26, stabbed the officer in the left arm with a folding knife outside Sogo department store when the policeman was trying to subdue Law Kok-sum, another defendant in the case. 

Hours after the assault, Wong boarded a plane bound for the United Kingdom, but was arrested by the police before it took off. 

He had earlier pleaded guilty to taking part in a riot and wounding the officer with intent.

In mitigation, Wong's lawyer said he was born to a poor family and had worked hard to achieve what he had. The lawyer said Wong was kind and loving, and was not a leader in the protest, but made a big mistake out of recklessness.

Sentencing Wong, the judge noted the injury could have cost the officer his life, adding that his career development had also been affected because he had since been deployed to handle administrative work.

The judge said the case was of a serious nature, but said he had taken into account Wong's guilty plea and his clear criminal record. 

Sentencing for Law, 20, was adjourned to October 31 pending a training centre report.

That's according to Lau Yu-lung, who is also the chair professor of paediatrics at the University of Hong Kong. 

He noted that the World Health Organisation has advised people to have a four- to eight-week window between the first and second shots to provide better protection while reducing the likelihood of heart muscle inflammation – a side effect associated with the jab. 

“Hong Kong is one of the first places which warned that the heart muscle inflammation [caused by the BioNTech shots] is not so rare, so we are very sensitive about this,” he said. 

On Wednesday, Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau approved the emergency use of the infant and children BioNTech formula in Hong Kong, but said there's no timetable yet on when the vaccines will be shipped to the city. 

“Hong Kong's epidemic situation had been improving, but the number of cases seems to be going up again. So, it's a dilemma. Perhaps we will advise a certain extent of flexibility after today's meeting. We'll see. But Hong Kong always puts safety first,” Lau said. 

At present, children aged between six months and three years old can get the Sinovac vaccine. Around 18 percent of the population in this age group has had their first jab, while less than ten percent has received the second shot. 

Separately, the Hospital Authority is relaxing visiting restrictions for acute and specialist wards across 38 hospitals from Thursday. 

Patients considered to be at lower risk of infection will be given a one-hour visiting slot each day, with a quota of three registered visitors. However, only two guests will be allowed into the ward at the same time. 

The authority's chief nursing officer, Leung Ming, said officials would assess the epidemic situation as well as the response from patients and their relatives before deciding whether to further relax the rules.";Radio Television Hong Kong

Speaking at a summit organised by the British Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, Lee said the SAR's international connectivity was close to his heart and that he was acutely aware of the concerns of the community and the business sector on the pace of opening up, but he stressed that public health remained a key priority. 

Why do we have to be careful in managing risks? Two reasons. First, we have to protect our high-risk population, especially the elderly and the very young. We are talking about human lives here. We cannot afford to do nothing, Lee said.

We want to reduce the number of critical cases and fatalities as much as we can. Second, we must do our utmost to ensure that our public health system would not be overwhelmed. Our hospitals must continue to provide adequate and efficient healthcare services to the people of Hong Kong.

But Lee told delegates that they could look to some exciting moments in the months ahead, with representatives of more than 100 major financial institutions expected for next month's Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit, and the return of the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens.

Addressing the theme of the summit, The Next 25 Years and Beyond, Lee said the coming years would be shaped by still entirely unknown opportunities – and challenges.

What I can tell you is that we are building the road to a bountiful future, to the economy and the community we want for Hong Kong – for ourselves, our businesses and our families, Lee said. 

That road is planned as a multi-lane, multi-layered, superhighway. While there may be bends along the way, the road and the prospects it will bring are designed to deliver, to take us where we want to go.

Lee told the summit that his maiden Policy Address next week would include new measures to attract, and retain, talent from abroad, and said he planned to make his first overseas trip as leader next month, heading to Bangkok for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders' meeting.";Radio Television Hong Kong

Photo courtesy of Orbis A charity which focuses on eye care said Hong Kong people have not been paying enough attention to their eye health, after its survey found that more than half of respondents had never checked their eyes. 

Orbis and the Hong Kong Ophthalmological Society surveyed 6,253 locals last month, and found that more than half of them had never had their eyes checked. 

The survey also found that 40 percent of the respondents had medium or high-risk of catching eye diseases, but almost half of them had never done an eye test either.

Emmy Li, the society's vice president and a volunteer doctor at Orbis, described the situation as worrying. 

I think the main reason is that, many people thought that if they are seeing okay, seeing fine, then they don't need an eye check-up. But in fact that is not the case, because there are many eye diseases that in the early stage, the symptom is not that obvious.

Meanwhile, 20 percent of respondents said they believe rubbing their eyes could help soothe discomfort, but Li said this is a misconception and may cause infection. 

If you rub your eyes a lot, there's risk that your hands are not clean enough, and you're introducing bacteria and germs and causing eye infection. Sometimes the more you rub, the more itchy that you feel. 

The doctor called on people not to ignore symptoms like flashes and floaters, saying they could be symptoms of more serious eye diseases. 

This is particularly worrying, because if you have floaters or flashes, it means that there's a possibility that you have some retinal problems, she said. 

In the worst case it can be an early symptom of retinal detachment, which is a blinding disease. So I think if individuals experience floaters or flashers, it is very needed that they should go to an eye check-up by a specialist. 

The survey also found that younger adults are less likely to check their eyes, with only one-third of respondents aged between 20 and 29 said they had done a comprehensive eye test. 

It's likely because teenagers usually see very well. They don't have a blurring vision and it's less likely that their eyes get dry, she said. 

Li called on people of all age groups to check their eyes regularly, to make sure they don't have hidden diseases.

The appeal for people to have better eye care comes on World Sight Day, a global campaign that aims to draw attention to blindness and visual impairment. It falls on the second Thursday of October.";Radio Television Hong Kong

File image: Shutterstock The government on Wednesday authorised the use of the baby and toddler version of the BioNTech coronavirus jab, but it says it is not sure when the vaccine will be supplied to Hong Kong.

At present, the BioNTech shot is only given to those aged five and above, while the Sinovac jab was made available for younger children in August.

The administration said in a statement that the health secretary considered the paediatric and toddler formulation of the BioNTech vaccine to fulfil the criteria of safety, efficacy and quality for emergency use in Hong Kong, after taking into account the views from experts on a government-appointed advisory panel.

The experts agreed the benefits of using the jab outweigh its risks. 

However, a government spokesman said it was waiting for the vaccine manufacturer to confirm when it can supply the jabs.

In the face of the threat posed by the highly transmissible mutant virus strains, children are among our focuses of protection in the Covid-19 vaccination programme. We call on parents to arrange vaccination for their children as early as possible without delay, thus enabling them to have early protection, he said.

Government advisers had previously said that BioNTech was safe for infants, but that they would require a dose around a tenth of that given to adults. They said the administration would have to source smaller doses as it was difficult to dilute the shots.

Meanwhile, the government says it will set up nine additional Covid-19 vaccination venues this month at convenient locations, including Mong Kok, Hung Hom, Wong Tai Sin, Quarry Bay, Tseung Kwan O and Tsuen Wan.";Radio Television Hong Kong

File photo: RTHK Eastern Court on Wednesday opted against jailing a social worker who admitted slapping, choking and pulling the hair of a special-needs pupil at the school where he worked, instead imposing a community service order.

Mak Yan-fung, 30, will have to carry out 140 hours of community work after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing to a charge of common assault.

The court heard that Mak assaulted the 21-year-old form six pupil, who had been diagnosed with autism and intellectual disabilities, at TWGHS Tsui Tsin Tong School in October last year. The attack was caught on CCTV and the defendant subsequently resigned from the school and confessed to the police.

In mitigation, counsel for Mak quoted the defendant's former boss as saying that he had always performed well at work, and that the incident came amid a manpower shortage at the school that day.

Passing sentence, magistrate Jason Wan said that even though the charge was not serious, it did involve a breach of good faith.

The Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union announced the new minimum pay scales after talks with members, contractors' groups and others in the sector. 

Plasterers will see pay increase by 12.5 percent while installers of false ceilings will get 12 percent and metal and marble workers will see pay increases of 7.7 percent. Other workers will get pay rises of at least 3 percent, though bar benders and concrete and excavation workers will continue to see their wages frozen. 

The union's chairman, Wong Ping, said the pay increases were mild and not ideal, but acknowledged that employers cannot pay higher salaries as they have to stick to budgets that are based on tenders won years ago. 

Yet Wong said the pay rise alone would not be enough to attract workers to the sector, adding that labour was in short supply after construction activity surged as the pandemic eased.

The union also called on the government to set standards for developers on the timescale for construction projects, saying a survey of members had found strong backing for the idea as a way of easing pressure to complete work quickly.

The group said it questioned 1,470 members in August and September on the matter and found that 83 percent backed the call.

“A few years ago, developers required us to construct a storey in six or seven days. But now they require us to complete it in three or four days,” said Ho Ping-tak, the union's conference development officer.

“The construction period is not reasonable. When workers plateau, accidents occur easily.”

As an example of the pressure workers were under, Tak cited an industrial accident in Yau Tong in August when work continued after the typhoon signal No 3 was issued. Three workers were injured.";Radio Television Hong Kong

The calls follow a decision by a school in Tsuen Wan to suspend 14 pupils for three days after they failed to turn up for the raising of the national flag.

Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Mervyn Cheung, the chairman of the Hong Kong Education Policy Concern Organisation, said the punishment imposed by St Francis Xavier's School was drastic, and said suspending pupils should be a last resort.

I think the EDB (Education Bureau) should consider revising the circular that it issued last year and be more specific with the penalties for non-compliance, he told RTHK's Ben Tse.

He said that the severity of any punishment could be based on factors such as whether the pupils were being negligent or whether their actions were deliberate. 

Lawmaker Tang Fei, who is also a secondary school principal, echoed Cheung's call for clarity on the matter of penalties. 

Speaking on another RTHK programme, Tang said this could help schools avoid giving the impression that class suspensions may be too harsh.

He defended the decision by St Francis Xavier's School, saying that it had followed the necessary protocols. 

It had stated clearly and taught its students on what should be done during a flag-raising ceremony, said Tang, adding that the school had informed the pupils' parents and the Education Bureau in accordance with guidelines after the incident. 

He said that schools should not be left to decide on what penalties to hand out, pointing out that there are laws governing the treatment of violations linked to the national flag, emblem and anthem.

Speaking on Tuesday at a forum on the SAR's development, Leung said while the further relaxation of Covid travel rules is an important factor for bringing investors back to Hong Kong, it is not the only issue that matters. 

The vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference said while many Hongkongers hope that investors will return to the city after officials bring in the “zero plus zero” policy, that won't be enough as overseas firms and key opinion leaders tend to have misunderstandings about Hong Kong. 

Not only do they not know [enough about Hong Kong], they have plenty of misunderstandings or superficial knowledge. Or they were misled, because of smearing campaigns by overseas media and politicians about what's really happening in Hong Kong, Leung said.

The former CE also said people need to be aware that Hong Kong is facing more opportunities than challenges as the country undergoes major changes. 

But he said to tap into the country's development momentum, Hong Kong needs to address a number of issues, namely people not knowing enough about the country's development, mainland firms not knowing about the SAR's advantages and overseas businesses knowing too little about Hong Kong's actual situation. 

The state leader added that Hong Kong ranks fourth in a recently-released United Nations Human Development Index, which measures people's health, knowledge and standard of living in different countries and regions. Leung noted that Singapore is ranked 12th and the United Kingdom 18th, but he said Hong Kong shouldn't be complacent and should continue to strive to improve.";Radio Television Hong Kong

Photo: RTHK A High Court judge has put on hold the invalidation by the government of some 20,000 Covid-19 vaccination exemption certificates issued by seven private doctors, pending a legal challenge.

Justice Russell Coleman on Tuesday issued an interim relief order to that effect until a judicial review hearing next week.

The application for the legal challenge was filed by Kwok Cheuk-kin, the so-called king of judicial reviews, who said the government should not nullify the exemption certificates before they are found to have been issued improperly by the doctors.

At a case management hearing at the High Court, government lawyers representing Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau said he had ordered that the certificates be invalidated to protect public health, as it would effectively ban their holders from entering restaurants and other premises.

They also said those affected by the move could consult another doctor to obtain a new exemption certificate, and could even see a government doctor for free.

The certificates were supposed to be invalidated from Wednesday. 

Justice Coleman said he made the decision mainly because the judicial review hearing would take place imminently, on Thursday next week.

Kwok welcomed the judge's decision. Hong Kong is a society [governed by] the rule of law... If the seven [doctors] were found not guilty by the court, and the vaccination exemption certificates were invalidated, who can compensate [those affected]? he told reporters outside court.";Radio Television Hong Kong

Before Tuesday, tourists visiting Japan needed to arrange a visa in advance and join organised tour groups. Since Tokyo announced it was easing the rules, airlines have been adding extra flights from the SAR to serve expected strong demand.

One family of three heading to Fukuoka said they expected to spend about 400,000 yen, or $21,500, on their three day trip, and the father of the family said he couldn't wait to create lasting memories with his daughter.

“I'm excited, I haven't travelled [to Japan] for too long, I couldn't sleep well last night… I will bring her [my daughter] to the zoo and to try on a kimono,” he said.

Another woman who was heading to Osaka with her husband said: “We've brought around 600,000 to 700,000 yen. [We'll] play hard and shop hard. Our last trip is already in February 2020.

“I've prepared an empty suitcase [for shopping] and added 20kg luggage allowance… I want to buy everything,” she added.

Hong Kong people made more than two million visits to Japan in 2019, according to figures from the Japan National Tourism Organisation.

The CEO of Hong Kong Express, Mandy Ng, told reporters that the easing of border curbs both in Hong Kong and Japan had encouraged independent travellers to plan their journeys, with flights to all Japanese cities on Tuesday very full. 

“We have opened all the check-in counters… we can see an enthusiastic market response after the zero-plus-three arrangement is announced,” She said, referring to the SAR government's decision to end hotel quarantine for incoming travellers. 

Ng added that the airline would increase the number of weekly flights to Japan from about 50 this month to 120 during the peak travel season in December, with a popular route to Tokyo Haneda Airport to be restored.

She said that by the end of March, the airline planned to run 460 flights a week, similar to pre-pandemic levels.

The airline announced previously that it was cancelling or rescheduling a number of flights in the coming months, angering some travellers who had booked seats. Asked about the decision, Ng said only that it was made after a “comprehensive review”.

“We notice that people, in general, are planning more advance for their travel compared to pre-Covid times. That's why we have conducted a comprehensive review on our flight schedule next year in order to give a more transparent outlook to our flight schedule so travelers can make their travel plan ahead,” Ng said.

Ng stressed that most of the affected flights had only been rescheduled, not cancelled, and all the affected passengers had been notified and offered a full refund.";Radio Television Hong Kong

The so-called sanction imposed on people in Hong Kong without justification, it is a very barbaric act. And I'm not going to comment on the effect of such a barbaric act, because officials in Hong Kong do what is right to protect the interests of the country and the interests of Hong Kong. So we will just laugh off the so-called sanctions, he told reporters ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting.

On a superyacht berthed in the SAR that is tied to a Russian businessman sanctioned by western countries, Lee said, We cannot do and will not do anything that has no legal basis.

The 56-year-old oligarch, Alexey Mordashov, has been the target of sanctions from the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States amid the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

But the CE made it clear Hong Kong will comply with United Nations sanctions. In Hong Kong, we will respect the rule of law, and we will do anything when there is a legal basis.

We will comply with any United Nations resolution on sanctions, because Hong Kong has the legal basis to enforce it… that is our system, that is our rule of law.

On a government move to put on hold plans to enact Article 23 of the Basic Law, Lee said there's a need to be more cautious when dealing with this piece of legislation. 

In terms of national security, risks are ever-changing, and we see rapid deterioration in geopolitics. In the past, we never imagined that some measures can be used to attack another country to threaten its national security. Against that background, we must be able to legislate an effective piece of legislation that can tackle extreme circumstances. Therefore, the legislation must be thorough and in-depth, Lee said.

We do not want to come out with a piece of legislation with loopholes, requiring us to review it again too soon.

He made the comment a day after Hong Kong reported two imported cases involving the two new Covid strains.

Speaking on a radio programme, the expert said XBB.1 is likely to replace the current BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants as the dominant strain.

But he said this should not be too much of a concern, as the current vaccines offered in Hong Kong are effective against the subvariant. 

He added that people should not wait for the second generation vaccine – which targets the BA.4 and BA.5 strains – as it would likely become “out of date” by the time it's available in the city. 

By the time we get the second generation vaccine by the end of this year or early next year, the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants will be history. It will be outdated, Lau said.

Greenpeace and the Liber Research Community said satellite images and site inspections had identified 433 hectares of large and accessible brownfield plots within the area designated for the administration's massive Northern Metropolis scheme but that are so far excluded from the development plans.

Hong Kong defines brownfield sites as land designated for agriculture but used for industrial purposes such as storage, workshops and recycling.

Karman Cheung of the Liber Research Community urged the administration to set a short-term target for making use of the plots the groups had identified, which she said could be ready for development in between four and six years, and yield about 108,000 homes.

She said sites covering 100 hectares, including areas around Kam Tin, were vacant already, and could boost land supply even more quickly.

Cheung brushed aside concerns that the brownfield sites were isolated pieces of land that would be unsuitable for housing development, saying the plots they had identified were on the edge of new development areas.

The 50-hectare brownfield located in the Lau Fau Shan district is one of the brownfield sites [at which] we think the government can quickly provide housing. That brownfield site is quite large, and it's also very easy to handle because it's next to the Hung Shui Kiu [New Development Area], she said. 

Chan Hall-sion, a senior campaigner at Greenpeace, urged the government to make good use of brownfield sites and rethink its proposals for a huge reclamation project off Lantau.

The Lantau Tomorrow [project] can only be completed at least 12 or 13 years later. So in terms of timing, Lantau Tomorrow isn't the answer to the problem in front of us, she said.

In terms of hectares of land Lantau Tomorrow can provide, it's being said there will be at least 200 hectares for housing. But alternatively... brownfields can provide more housing land because just in Northern Metropolis there are 433 hectares of 'instant brownfields'.

Researchers under the Jockey Club Holistic Support Project for Elderly Mental Wellness surveyed 4,921 people aged 60 or above from April to June. They found that about one-third of them suffered from emotional distress, showing signs of depression, anxiety or loneliness.

They said the risk of depression among the elderly was up two-thirds while the risk of anxiety rose by around 60 percent compared with a similar study in 2020.

Professor Terry Lum from the HKU Department of Social Work and Social Administration cited a disruption of routines during the fifth wave.

For example, they used to go to breakfast at a dim sum restaurant in the morning, or they go to the park to do exercise or tai chi with friends. But now with the prolonged social isolation, they have stopped these kinds of activities for a long time. 

The study also found that more than 25 percent of the respondents expressed worries about the pandemic, with the top concern being they would burden their families if they come down with the virus.

If you look at for example the figures or pictures from newspapers or TV, the elderly people waiting outside the hospital for a place in the emergency room... Those kinds of pictures have a very profound effect on the emotion of older people, Lum said.

They will think if unluckily I got infected, I would likely be one of those people waiting outside in cold weather on rainy days to get into the emergency room.

Lum added that many people were not even aware that they had symptoms or did not know where to seek help.

There are community resources available. But in Hong Kong, older people's mental health literacy is not very high, that means they don't know where to seek help. Many of them even are not aware of the symptoms, he said.

File image: Shutterstock People who cash in by hogging bookings for public sports and recreation facilities are to face tougher penalties including lengthy bans as officials clamp down on touting activities, the government said on Monday. 

The Leisure and Cultural Services Department said it was also working on a system that will introduce a ballot for bookings instead of a purely first-come, first-served arrangement as it seeks to weed out those who book facilities with the intention of selling the use of the facilities at a profit.

The department says that from November 1 it will ban anyone who books a facility and fails to use it twice in a 60-day period from making a new booking for the subsequent 90 days. At present, people are only banned if they fail to honour bookings twice in 30 days. 

People who are found to have transferred the use of a a user permit for a particular facility without authorisation will be suspended from booking sports facilities for 360 days, doubling the current penalty.

The department is also tightening up the rules for booking natural and artifical turf football pitches through its online Leisure Link system. As well as giving their own user number, they'll also have to submit the details of four other registered users.

The person who makes the booking and three of the four other registered users will have to show their identity documents and any qualifications that are required before kicking off their session. 

The department will also bring forward the time at which people are allowed to try to book a session cancelled by other users. They'll open up from 7am, instead of 7.30am. A department spokesman said the change meant cancelled bookings would open up at the same time as other types of bookings.

The spokesman said the department would monitor how well the new measures work and would take further action against touts if necessary.

The daily tally of new Covid infections has hovered between 4,000 and 5,000 in recent days, ending a recent downward trend, while there has been concern that new Omicron sub-variants such as BA.2.75 might worsen the epidemic situation. 

Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Kwok Kin-on, a professor of public health at the Chinese University, said there would be no need to tighten Covid measures unless there is a drastic increase in hospital admissions and deaths.

We should focus on the number of serious cases and deaths. Even if the infection figures jump significantly, it's still appropriate to maintain the existing measures if the proportion of serious cases and deaths remain low, he said. 

However, he noted the inoculation rate among elderly people is still not very high.

He suggested that the government could consider introducing the newly developed vaccines targetting the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sub-variants to better protect elderly people. The administration said on Sunday that it was considering an application from manufacturer BioNTech to authorise the use of the updated booster vaccine here. 

Speaking on the same programme, an adviser to the government on coronavirus strategy, Ivan Hung, echoed Kwok's views, saying Hong Kong already had strong hybrid immunity against Covid from vaccination and previous infections. 

He added that although the new BA.2.75 variant is more infectious and is more capable of infecting people who are vaccinated, evidence so far shows most cases are either mild or asymptomatic. 

The University of Hong Kong professor agreed that new vaccines targetting Omicron strains would be better than the ones now used in the SAR. 

Even though the BA.4 and BA.5 vaccine may not match the new BA.2.75 variant completely, the efficacy is still better than the first-generation vaccine, he said.

“In light of the community's concern, we'd like to further expedite the progress,” he said.

The foster home, run by the Hong Kong Society for the Protection of Children, will have to prove it is still capable of providing services subsidised by the Social Welfare Department, said Lee. 

“According to the mechanism, progress reports will have to be submitted to the Social Welfare Department every three months, and within the one-year period, we keep in view whether they have improved their situations, and depending on the performance decide whether to extend the surveillance period,” she said.

The HA's remote service programme allows eligible patients to make appointments and seek advice from doctors via an app, without having to visit clinics or hospitals in person. 

The HA says it has served more than 45,000 patients since the app was launched two years ago. 

Dr Joanna Pang, a chief medical informatics officer at the HA, said those who were invited to join the scheme tended to be chronically ill patients who are nevertheless in a stable condition.

For the patient selection, most of the time we will select patients we consider as stable, or [someone] having a chronic disease, such that upon the consultation most of the time during the follow up, we may use the teleconsultation to follow up the case, she said. 

She stressed that the service is accessed a voluntary basis, and that service quality is no different from that found in traditional consultations as both are guided by the same protocols.

Those who are aged 50 or above or have an impaired immune system can get their fourth shot three months after the third, while people aged between 18 and 49 can receive the booster dose after a six-month window.

The society's president, William Chui, said while a survey it conducted with 506 people in the past two months showed that around 74 percent had been triple-jabbed against Covid, only about 6 percent had got their fourth dose of the vaccine.

Results of the survey indicated that they didn't want to receive the fourth dose of the Covid-19 vaccine mainly because they thought the third dose was enough to protect them. They thought that the antibody level was enough for the coming winter but in fact there may be [a resurgence] of Covid-19 then, he said.

Chui urged people not to wait for the next generation of Covid vaccines, especially when other places are seeing new Omicron subvariants like BA.2.75 and BA.2.75.2.

The subvariant BA.2.75.2 is a main concern, because it developed resistance to the drug therapy which is available in Hong Kong, including the Remdesivir injection and also oral antiviral drugs for the treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19.

Chui added that another survey they did in September and earlier this month showed 47 percent of 147 parents polled had not or would not get their children inoculated against Covid.

He said the parents were worried about the side effects of the vaccine or that it would cause allergies.

The pharmacist said the results were concerning, and called on the authorities to introduce the BioNTech jab for those aged below five in order to boost the vaccination rate.

The call was made by the Society for Community Organisation (Soco) on Sunday, which also said the official target to build 20,000 transitional homes in the coming few years should be increased to 50,000.

“We recommend the government should do the construction for the social housing. It's easier for them because they have the departments to build the housing,” said Soco's deputy director, Sze Lai-shan, who noted many transitional housing projects are being led by NGOs

“And then for NGOs, they can help to deliver services and run the whole residency,” said Sze. 

She said authorities should look for idle plots or buildings suitable for transitional flats, conduct survey and planning, and then assign the Housing Society or the Housing Authority to the construction. 

Sze said the NGOs can then assess the needs of the residents and design services that can help alleviate them from poverty in the long run, such as building skills to maintain a healthy lifestyle and cope with adversity.

Writing on his blog, Chan noted that many people had been comparing the financial markets of Hong Kong and Singapore, but that some had been basing their standpoints on rather vague impressions. 

To show Hong Kong's merits, Chan listed a number of figures. They included the size and transaction volumes of their respective stock markets, foreign exchange services, bond markets, green finance, and asset management. 

“In the discussion on how we can strengthen our weaknesses, the figures let us have an objective understanding of Hong Kong's real advantages,” he said. 

“Hong Kong had been developing and growing amid competition. There is no need to sell ourselves short or avoid our shortcomings. We just have to be pragmatic, and introduce a targeted strategy, in order to enhance our financial market's competitiveness,” Chan added.

Meanwhile, he also announced that next month's gathering of top finance professionals, organised by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), had received such an enthusiastic response that authorities have decided to host another forum on the next day. 

Chan said many international financial institutions, not invited to the event on November 2, had written to enquire and some participants said the one-day meeting was not quite long enough. 

He said the HKMA and the Hong Kong Academy of Finance had therefore decided to host a forum the following day on global investment.

He made the remarks in a social media post, where he said the government was doing its best to prevent a resurgence in case numbers, so the city doesn't have to “backtrack on the road to normality”. 

He noted the business sector had been calling on the government to scrap the so called 0+3 rule, under which inbound travellers no longer have to undergo hotel quarantine, but are given an amber health code which bans them from going to restaurants, bars, and a range of other places, for the first three days following their arrival in the territory. 

“But we must balance the risk in our anti-epidemic efforts, otherwise the loss will outweigh the gain if there's a rebound,” said Chan. 

He said those in business were now able to inspect their companies, meet clients, and take part in exhibitions as soon as they had landed in Hong Kong. 

“As risks remain under control, different international tournaments, activities and concerts can now be held, and they will restore Hong Kong's international reputation as a vibrant city and enhance its competitiveness,” he said.

The HA's chief executive, Tony Ko, said on Saturday that officials would keep a close eye on developments, with other variants also emerging in different parts of the world.

From recently available data overseas, we notice that in general, the seriousness of the patients infected with the new subvariant is roughly similar to conditions of those infected with the BA.5, he told reporters.

Ko stressed that officials needed to collect more data to be sure because it's still early days for the new variant.

He said public hospitals were prepared to handle more patients over the winter, when the expected surge for seasonal flu may coincide with a rebound in Covid infections.

Preparations include bringing back more designated Covid clinics and remote consultations by video link. Public hospital capacity will also be increased and more patients sent to private hospitals.

The Centre for Health Protection said people could develop more serious complications if they are infected with both viruses simultaneously. 

Dr Albert Au from the centre said the upcoming winter flu season could be bad, appealing to the public to get vaccinated against both flu and Covid. 

There's scientific evidence showing that if a person is co-infected with both Covid and influenza, there will be increased risk in death and hospitalisation requiring ventilation support, he said. 

Dr Thomas Tsang, honorary consultant of the Health Department, pointed out that a severe flu season would cause between 300 and 400 deaths in the past, warning that the situation will be worse if coupled with a Covid-19 outbreak. 

We have never been hit by surges of both flu and Covid-19 at the same time, but it may happen this year. You can imagine it will bring significant pressure to our hospitals, he said. 

Hong Kong reported 4,369 new Covid-19 infections on Friday, including 386 imported cases. 

Au noted that the number of local infections and hospitalisations had plateaued in recent days, with no significant further drop in cases.

The general population has waning immunity. Due to their previous infection, they have some immunity against the Omicron virus, he said. 

However, as time goes by their immunity acquired from previous infection has been decreasing... so the susceptible population will increase. That may lead to a significant number of cases remaining in the community.

He said the number of imported cases has significantly increased recently, but existing measures have been effective in preventing these infections from spreading in the community. 

Meanwhile, he noted that a new Covid variant, BA.2.75, has caused a jump in the daily Covid caseload in Singapore recently. 

He said officials are closely monitoring the situation as a similar rebound could happen in Hong Kong as well.

The two redevelopment schemes, which are expected to conclude by 2033, will cover an area of 217,000 square feet at sites in Ming Lun Street and Ma Tau Kok Road and at To Kwa Wan Road and Ma Tau Kok Road. Buildings affected include scores of tenements and two industrial buildings. 

Lawrence Mak, the URA's general manager for planning and design, says the work will help create space for a 20-metre wide waterfront promenade that will link up with the Kai Tak Development Area.

The authority also plans to reserve space between the two development sites for a waterfront plaza with on-street dining and shops that it hopes will make it easier for people to walk between To Kwa Wan Road and the promenade.

These two open spaces could actually connect the old urban areas to the waterfront and provide a lot of amenities, areas and visual and ventilation benefits to the community, Mak said. 

The authority says almost 3,000 residents in about 1,400 households will have to move out, while 100 shops and 90 industrial users will also be affected.

Officials say the redeveloped area will provide some 2,200 new flats.

The URA says the revamp is likely to be extra challenging because it involves units in industrial buildings, which have proved tricky to acquire in the past. 

We were facing some owners holding many interests; they were not willing to sell their properties to the URA, said Kelvin Chung, a general manager for acquisition and clearance. 

He says the authority is looking into a new approach; instead of seeking to buy the properties, it may allow owners to take part in the redevelopment themselves.

The URA will set criteria for these owners to join the project, including the number of industrial units they hold in the area, he added.

File photo: AFP The president of the Hong Kong Travel Agent Owners Association says the government needs to do more to encourage international carriers to come back to the SAR. 

Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Freddy Yip welcomed the Tourism Board's plan to spend $100 million on a global advertising campaign to promote Hong Kong. But he said even residents were finding it difficult to get air tickets to fly home and stressed that relaxing pandemic restrictions and helping airlines to return should be the top priorities.

Along with global advertising promotions, we need to encourage more international carriers to come back, Yip told RTHK's Samantha Butler. Right now, even for residents or their relatives who want to come back to Hong Kong it's hard to get an air ticket because most of the carriers have suspended their services.

In tandem with the Tourism Board's promotion efforts, the Airport Authority has announced it will give away 500,000 airline tickets worth HK$2 billion to attract more in-bound travellers. 

Yip said this was a good sign that Hong Kong wanted to re-open but added that the city was not yet ready for more visitors. 

Firstly, we need to further relax pandemic measures, including no restrictions on tourists coming back to Hong Kong, he said. And secondly, the cost of airline seats needs to come down. Subsidies and concessions, or reduced landing fees, would help to encourage foreign carriers to come back.

Yip added that most Hong Kong travel agents had laid off staff during the pandemic and were waiting for tourism to resume before they re-hired people.

British carrier Virgin Atlantic announced on Wednesday that it was ending its service from the SAR to London and closing its local office.

Cathay Pacific has said it intends to run services at one-third of pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year, and on Thursday rejected claims from its pilots' union that a shortage of cockpit crew would undermine its attempt to revive services.

File photo: RTHK Officials say they're planning to double the levy stores must charge for plastic bags to HK$1 from December 31.

The government is set to table a motion on doubling the plastic bag levy at the Legislative Council on October 19, and a vote is expected. That would pave the way for the higher levy to take effect at the end of the year. 

In a paper submitted to the legislature on Thursday, the Environment and Ecology Bureau said it expects a 25 percent drop in plastic bag disposal after the measure takes effect. 

Authorities also suggested removing the levy exemptions for chilled or frozen food, as well as food items fully wrapped in non-airtight packaging.

While the levy does not apply to takeaway food or unpackaged food items, each purchase or order will be limited to one free plastic bag. 

Some lawmakers and green groups had called for an increase in the levy to HK$2 to have a stronger deterrent effect.";Radio Television Hong Kong

File photo: RTHK The High Court on Thursday sentenced a former policeman to four years in prison for repeatedly forcing his young son to perform indecent acts. 

The defendant, identified only as FSL to protect his son, had earlier been convicted by a jury of two counts of indecent conduct towards a child under 16 and two counts of inciting a child under 16 to commit an act of gross indecency.

The court heard that from 2016 to December 2018, FSL had forced his son, referred to as X in court and who was aged 10 to 12 at the time, to masturbate alongside him. 

The boy was also threatened with violence, the court heard.

In passing sentence, Justice Alex Lee said the defendant had indulged himself in sex and had poisoned his son by twisting his ideas about sex. 

The judge said it was an aggravating factor that FSL was a police officer when he committed the crimes as he had damaged people's trust in the force.

Photo: RTHK The Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority on Thursday expressed concern that Hong Kong's poor economy could lead to companies failing to make contributions to their workers' accounts.

It said there has been a rising trend of defaults since the pandemic began. 

From April to August this year, it sent out around 29,000 notices each month to employers who didn't make contributions on time – 15 percent more than during the same period last year. 

Over the same months this year, the authority successfully recovered some HK$69 million in unpaid contributions.

Its chairwoman, Ayesha Lau, said officials are proactively contacting workers who need help.

We are concerned about possible rising instances of default contributions. That's understandable as well because of the economic situation, she told reporters.

Lau said that in the 2020-21 financial year, the authority was able to recover nearly HK$200 million in unpaid MPF contributions from employers, nearly HK$60 million more than the amount recovered in 2021-22.

She said that was likely because of the government's Employment Support Scheme to help firms with paying wages, which required companies to provide MPF contribution records.";Radio Television Hong Kong

The airline says rebuilding its capacity is its top priority, but will take time. File image: Shutterstock Cathay Pacific on Thursday rejected claims from the union representing the majority of its cockpit crew that an exodus of pilots has left it in no position to fully resume its operations, though the airline acknowledged that rebuilding capacity after the Covid pandemic will take time. 

The Hong Kong Aircrew Officers Association (HKAOA) had said in a statement that a shortage of qualified pilots was undermining Cathay's efforts to rebuild capacity and damaging Hong Kong's status as an international aviation hub.

The union said the airline now employed fewer than 2,500 pilots, compared to more than 4,000 in October 2020, the month in which Cathay imposed what union leaders described as a ruthless permanent reduction in pay and conditions of service on frontline staff.

The HKAOA said the departures were concentrated among senior crew who had been with the airline for decades, and said experienced pilots were continuing to resign at unprecedented rates.

In a statement to RTHK, Cathay said: Cathay Pacific has sufficient qualified and experienced aviation professionals to continue to support the current operation and operate at the highest levels of safety and customer service.

We remain focused on building connectivity between Hong Kong and the world as swiftly as we possibly can. However, it will still take time to rebuild our capacity as we build operational readiness and undertake a substantial amount of training and aircraft reactivation.

This, combined with other operational complexities, means that capacity can only be increased gradually over time.

Cathay said the reduction in passenger flights to a fraction of normal levels during the Covid pandemic had left many aircrew needing to renew licences. But it said a training plan was under way, along with a comprehensive recruitment programme that will see 4,000 staff hired over the coming 18 to 24 months. 

We will build capacity and add more flights to our network. This remains our priority, the statement added.

The company said changes to pay were required to create a more focused, more efficient and more competitive business for the post-Covid travel landscape, adding: Our goal was to protect as many jobs as possible, whilst meeting our responsibilities to the Hong Kong aviation hub and our customers.

Along with its subsidiaries, Cathay had 20,800 employees globally by June 30, down from 34,200 at the end of 2019, after cutting thousands of roles during the pandemic, Reuters reported.

Cathay had said last month that it planned to increase flight capacity to one-third of pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year after the SAR eliminated mandatory hotel quarantine and eased entry requirements, including for air crew. (RTHK/Reuters)";Radio Television Hong Kong

Photo: AP Legendary Hong Kong film star Tony Leung said that after 40 years in the business, he's having more fun than ever playing diverse roles – though he's still hoping to be cast as a serial killer.

Leung, who was awarded the Asian Cineaste of the Year prize at South Korea's Busan International Festival, is best known for his work with famed director Wong Kar-wai.

Half a dozen of his films, including Wong's In the Mood for Love (2000) and Happy Together (1997), will be screened at the festival, which is Asia's largest and runs until October 14.

The 60-year-old actor, who made his debut on television in 1981, told reporters in Busan that he loved complex roles that made him think, and said he has had more chances to play them later in his career.

I think the first 20 years were about learning, and the second 20 years were about showing what you have learned, Leung said on Thursday.

He said he was at a point where I can enjoy being an actor without being stressed. It's a lot of fun as I can now play more diverse roles, and characters I can act as I get older.

Some of Leung's best-known roles include a ruthless Chinese politician collaborating with the invading Japanese in Ang Lee's 2007 period drama Lust, Caution, and an undercover policeman in Andrew Lau and Alan Mak's Infernal Affairs series.

He made his Hollywood debut in 2021 by playing a well-layered supervillain in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, a superhero film based on Marvel Comics.

Personally, I would like to try playing a serial killer, he said, adding he's also interested in returning to television, which is experiencing something of a golden age thanks to streaming money.

Busan Film Festival director and acclaimed film critic Huh Moon-young said Leung is incomparable with other actors of his generation.

Among Leung's works are many masterpieces that will long remain in the history of world cinema, Huh told reporters.

Leung has long been a well-liked figure in South Korea – where Hong Kong cinema enjoyed peak popularity in the early 1990s –and first appeared at the Busan festival in 1997.

Since then, South Korea has cemented its status as a global cultural powerhouse, thanks in part to the explosive success of the Oscar-winning film Parasite and the Netflix series Squid Game.

Leung said the festival has come a long way since his first experience in Busan.

When I first visited the Busan festival, the opening ceremony was held after the organisers set up a small stage on a narrow road, Leung said, adding that he lost a shoe during the chaos.

It seems like things have been changed as I got to see such a grand opening ceremony yesterday. It was very nice to see.

Leung said he would like to work with two of South Korea's top stars: actor Song Kang-ho of Parasite fame and actress Jeon Do-yeon.

I'm willing to go anywhere, including South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, as long as things are meant to be, he said.

File photo: RTHK Executive councillor Ronny Tong on Thursday said the government's move to invalidate some 20,000 vaccine pass exemption certificates should not be considered a rule of law issue.

Some people, including legislator Doreen Kong, have criticised the decision by health authorities to invalidate certificates issued by seven doctors who allegedly didn't hold medical consultations with the recipients. They said the doctors were suspected but not convicted of wrongdoing, and the move to revoke the certificates lacked a legal basis.

“To elevate the debate into a question of whether the rule of law in Hong Kong has been breached is an overreaction. It is way beyond the necessity of the debate we are having at the moment,” Tong told RTHK. 

The executive councillor said people are free to challenge the legal basis of the decision by way of a judicial review. “I accept that people may have different views. If the views involve the legality of a government decision, then I think judicial review is always the proper and the only channel to deal with it. 

Separately, the government announced that people affected by the move can consult a doctor at a government general out-patient clinic at no cost, to see if they are eligible for a new exemption certificate.";Radio Television Hong Kong
