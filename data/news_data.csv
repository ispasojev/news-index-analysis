The Business and Professionals Alliance lawmaker's comment came a day after several legislators who serve on CUHK's council said they were not consulted ahead of the announcement. 

The university had earlier claimed that it had sought the advice of 2,200 stakeholders on the matter. 

But Leung, who's also a CUHK alumnus, said she's disappointed that she had not been approached, adding that more parties should be consulted over the issue. 

It's not a very minor matter for the university. From my own point of view, it's even more important than changes of personnel at the university. We see that apart from the council, the alumni and many of the stakeholders are completely unaware of the change. So it seems that there's a lack of consultation to the stakeholders of the university which should include alumni of different generations, she said. 

On Monday, the university wrote in a statement that the new emblem would have a pure purple background instead of split colours, in order to provide a clearer, more distinctive and dynamic look of the mythical Chinese phoenix. 

It will also introduce a simplified logo for digital use, removing its motto, through learning and temperance to virtue, originally placed at the bottom of the emblem. 

Leung said she and many other alumni were frustrated by the dropping of the university's motto in the simplified version of the emblem, as the motto reflects the soul and spirit of the university. 

Leung, who is chairwoman of Legco's panel on education, added that the incident highlights the need to amend the CUHK Ordinance, to hold the publicly funded university more accountable.";Radio Television Hong Kong

Photo: RTHK A man who is challenging the government's bid to annul some 20,000 Covid vaccine exemption certificates has been granted legal aid for the case.

Kwok Cheuk kin's application for legal aid had earlier been rejected on the grounds that he's not directly affected by the case because he's triple jabbed. 

But speaking outside the High Court on Tuesday, Kwok said he has successfully appealed against the decision. 

The reason for the successful appeal is that it's a case of public interest and the Legal Aid Department should not reject me, Kwok cited the judge as saying.

Kwok, who is also dubbed king of judicial reviews for the numerous legal challenges he filed, will return to court on Thursday for a hearing on his judicial review on the government's attempt to invalidate vaccine exemption certificates issued by seven doctors suspected of giving them out without conducting proper medical consultations. 

The certificates allow people who are not fully vaccinated to enter premises like restaurants.

Speaking at a groundbreaking ceremony for the $400mn development at the Hong Kong Business Aviation Centre (HKBAC), Lam said the government had taken steps to reopen the SAR and hailed a recent increase in air traffic. He said the sector could boost its development by tapping into growth in demand for business aviation in the Greater Bay Area.

'Past experience points to the resilience of the aviation market, so we believe that a strong rebound is on the horizon for Hong Kong's aviation industry as a whole. That makes the expansion of the HKBAC today a timely investment in the bright future that our aviation sector is to welcome,' he said.

Lam said Hong Kong's aviation sector had already been given a vote of confidence by the central government that would help the industry unleash its potential.

'Both the National 14th Five Year Plan and the Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong Hong Kong Macao Greater Bay Area have clearly indicated support for Hong Kong to consolidate and enhance its role as an international aviation hub, ' he said.

Officials at the centre said they'd seen the number of flights double since last month, when the administration abolished hotel quarantine for people arriving in the SAR. They said forthcoming international events were also boosting traffic. 

Sheree Cheung, the centre's director of administration and business development, said it was welcoming as many passengers from the mainland as from overseas, and she hoped the easing of border controls would further increase the number of mainland travellers. 

'In the past, the [number of] international and mainland guests are comparable. [The two] are similar. International guests need to visit the Asia headquarters through Hong Kong to invest in the mainland, or vice versa – where mainlanders make international investment [trips] through Hong Kong. Hong Kong is a convenient transit station,' she said.

Madonna Fung, the centre's general manager, told reporters that the expansion would consolidate Hong Kong's status as an international aviation hub, and take advantage of its dual gateway role in connecting the mainland and the rest of the world.

File photo: RTHK The High Court on Tuesday threw out an appeal by eight activists who were convicted of flouting a Covid 19 gathering ban during a petition two years ago.

Former lawmakers Lee Cheuk yan and Leung Kwok hung, along with six others, were each given a suspended sentence of 14 days behind bars after they gathered outside government headquarters in Admiralty on May 1, 2020 to call on the administration to hand out unemployment subsidies.

At the time, no more than four people were allowed at a gathering.

Handing down his verdict, judge Albert Wong said the defendants from the League of Social Democrats and the Labour Party had taken part in a banned gathering with no reasonable excuse, and their convictions were supported by sufficient evidence.

Wong said he refused to accept the argument that as long as people were 1.5 metres apart from each other, it would not constitute a gathering.

Even if they really kept a distance of 1.5 metres, it would be wishful thinking to think there was no risk of transmission [of the virus], the judge wrote.

Wong added that the regulation prohibiting gatherings was constitutional and struck a reasonable balance between protecting public health and the freedom to peaceful assembly.

The judge also dismissed the appeal against the sentences, saying the two week jail terms suspended for 18 months were not overly harsh.";Radio Television Hong Kong

Image: Shutterstock The government is seeking to speed up implementing a ban on the use of disposable plastic tableware, meaning restaurants will have to swap items such as plastic straws, cutlery and plates for more eco friendly options as early as the fourth quarter of next year. 

Authorities had originally hoped to phase out single use plastic tableware from 2025, while further extending the ban to plastic cups and their lids as well as food containers and their covers between 12 and 18 months later. 

However, green groups have called on the administration to bring in the two phase ban earlier and fully implement the entire scheme by 2025.

In a paper submitted to the Legislative Council on Tuesday, the Environment and Ecology Bureau said authorities plan to put in place the first phase of the scheme as early as the fourth quarter of 2023 – six months after the expected passage of the amended Product Eco responsibility Ordinance. 

We notice that, at present, most of the suppliers in the market are already able to provide non plastic alternatives (eg paper, soft wood, etc) to disposable plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery and plates that are covered by the first phase of the regulation, and their prices are generally comparable to the corresponding plastic ones, the bureau said. 

Under the first phase, the SAR will prohibit the sale and use of disposable expanded polystyrene tableware at catering premises, as well as disposable plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery and plates. 

As for plastic cups and food containers as well as their covers, restaurants will initially be barred from providing these items for dine in customers, before the ban is expanded to takeaways in the second phase tentatively set for 2025. 

The bureau said offenders could face a fixed penalty of HK$2,000. 

However, pre packaged food and drink products with disposable plastic items, such as straws attached to beverage cartons, and single use tableware for medical or security needs, will be exempted from the ban. 

The government is also looking to bar the sale and free distribution of other plastic products, including cotton buds, umbrella bags, and hotel toiletries, as early as the fourth quarter of next year.";Radio Television Hong Kong

Earlier, the sole delegate to the country's top legislature, Tam Yiu chung, revealed that the so called reverse quarantine plan had hit a snag due to technical complications, such as difficulties with hiring enough people to manage the isolation facilities. 

Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said both the mainland and SAR authorities are still working to iron out some challenges.

We have to agree on the arrangement so that when a person having gone through the pre departure quarantine arrangement, he will be considered having fulfilled the 'seven plus three' arrangement, he said, referring to the mainland's Covid policy of a week in hotel quarantine and another three days of self monitoring at home. 

The CE stressed the importance of making sure the arrangement does not pose any extra risks to the mainland. 

For anybody who has gone through this pre departure quarantine, because the standard has been made in accordance with the mainland standard  the only thing we need to do is to ensure that they are also transported to the mainland in a closed loop way, Lee said.

We are conscious of the fact that Hong Kong has to maintain [connections] both to the world and to the mainland. We are working towards both goals at the same time. Of course, I will have to wait for further ideas from our mainland counterparts so that we can really work out on the details. 

Separately, Lee was asked whether the local legislation of a national security law would be one of the highlights of his policy address to be delivered on Wednesday. 

In response, the CE reiterated that officials will have to conduct extensive research to make sure the future legislation is able to keep up with the fast changing geopolitical environment. 

'I would like our [Article 23] proposal to cover a very wide range of research into the legislations that are available for reference, in connection with means and tactics of protecting national security, so as to ensure that the final proposal will be able to deal with all the anticipated situations and circumstances.'

Meanwhile, Lee said President Xi Jinping's report delivered at the opening of the Communist Party's 20th congress had mentioned Hong Kong, Macau and the One Country Two Systems repeatedly, which shows the central government's deep concern for the two SARs.

File image: Shutterstock The head of a group connecting businesses in Singapore and Hong Kong on Tuesday hailed the rivalry between the two cities as healthy, but said the SAR's role as a gateway to the mainland could not be replaced.

Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Philip Chan, president of the Hong Kong Singapore Business Association, said the SAR's geographical advantages meant it would never be edged out by its competitors, though he urged officials in the territory to offer more incentives to bring in companies and individuals.

Asked about rivalry between the cities, Singapore based Chan told RTHK's Samantha Butler: It is a very healthy competition; it's just like playing golf, it's not like boxing. Sometimes even competitors, they want to knock out each other.

Recently our Deputy Prime Minister [Heng Swee Keat] visited Hong Kong and always emphasised [that] Singapore has a lot of investment in Hong Kong, so we want to enjoy the mutual cooperation to develop more business with each other.

Chan is making his first visit to Hong Kong since November 2020 and said he found the SAR's latest 0+3 border regulations, under which new arrivals must undergo three days of medical surveillance before being allowed to visit venues such as restaurants, to be convenient.

However, he said he hoped Hong Kong officials would be able to remove all restrictions soon. 

We are looking forward to seeing the so called 0+0, which will provide much more convenience, not just for business travellers. We business travellers already don't mind 0+3, but Hong Kong is very reliant on tourists. I hope Hong Kong can remain a tourist hub.

Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme on Tuesday, Andy Kwan, chair of the ACE Centre for Business and Economic Research said officials had to show that Hong Kong had a positive future at a time when, as he put it, the local economy is going downhill. 

You have to look at education, he told RTHK's Damon Pang. We all know that vacancies in international schools are basically very low and trying to get a place in an international school is very competitive.

If the government is able to make the conditions better, in terms of education, in terms of housing, in terms of pay, I think that will be the main three things the package should be considered.

In order to attract businesses, Kwan said lower tax rates, offering concessions on tax and making it easier to set up operations in Hong Kong would all help. 

To help small  and medium sized local businesses, Kwan said the administration could take steps to bring in more skilled foreign or mainland workers to counteract a reduction in the local labour force.

File image: Shutterstock Cathay Pacific said on Monday that it plans to add 700 flights in November and 1,200 flights in December, as passenger figures improved following the lifting of mandatory hotel quarantine for airport arrivals last month. 

We remain focused on adding as many passenger flights as we can, and have already added more than 400 flight sectors in October to and from regional and long haul destinations since the September announcements by the government, Cathay said in a statement. 

It said many of the additional flights are bound for popular destinations such as Tokyo, Osaka and London, adding that it's noticed a considerable increase in demand for flights to Singapore, Bangkok and Seoul.

But the flag carrier said while the number of passengers it carried last month doubled from a year ago to 265,845, it was still down almost 90 percent compared to the same month in 2019. 

It said it's on track to reach its target of doubling its total number of destinations from the level it offered in January, to 58 by the end of the year. It's restored services to Madrid, Milan, Dubai, Kathmandu and Bengaluru this month.

Separately, Cathay said cargo tonnage fell nearly 21 percent year on year to 104,055 tonnes in September, as a result of the base effect from an exceptionally high level of cargo recorded in the same month last year.

But the airline also conceded that the decline was larger than expected because of weaker consumer demand and lower manufacturing activities on the mainland.";Radio Television Hong Kong

Speaking on the first day of the SAR's Investment Promotion Week, Chan acknowledged that Hong Kong had seen people go elsewhere and faced challenges to its competitive status during the pandemic, but said Chief Executive John Lee's maiden Policy Address on Wednesday would introduce highly favourable terms and measures to attract enterprises and talent.

He also stressed that the SAR enjoyed strong support from the motherland, including initiatives in the nation's 14th five year plan.

Chan hit out at a recent article headlined 'Which city will be the next Hong Kong?', which implied that rival destinations were lining up to steal the SAR's crown. He responded: 'There is only one Hong Kong. And it is not going anywhere. You can count on that.

Yes, we've had a bumpy ride the last few years. But our social unrest has given way to stability and business opportunity,' Chan continued. 

'Despite the difficulties we encountered due to the Covid 19 pandemic – be they loss of talents or challenges to our competitive status – no city, no financial centre in the world, can eclipse our vaunted strengths and celebrated advantages.'

Chan cited the SAR's world class infrastructure, welcoming business environment, competitive tax regime, and internationally aligned regulatory regime as key econonomic advantages.

The minister stressed that Hong Kong had been 'rationalising' its anti epidemic measures to prepare for 'the world's return', lining up events such as next month's global financial summit and the rugby sevens – the rugby summit, as Chan put it.

'Along with a more modest Covid situation, we have been rationalising our anti epidemic measures and easing quarantine and travel arrangements, on a science  and evidence based and targeted approach. The goal is to reduce the inconvenience of cross boundary travel, and allow us to revive the economy and return to normality as early as possible.'

'The relaxation of quarantine arrangements for arrivals to 0+3 recently is another important step in this direction,' he said.

Looking ahead, Chan said officials wanted to strengthen Hong Kong's position as a centre for asset management, risk management and green finance, while legislation was on its way to set up a licensing regime for providers of virtual assets.

The council examined 13 models of children's toothpaste, and found that three of them – under the brands 'Elmex, Dr Brown's and Tom's –had a pH level lower than the mainland standard, which may affect dental and oral health. A lower pH level indicates higher acidity.

It is essential for the children to nurture the good habit of cleaning their teeth and oral cavity from a young age, in order to ensure the healthy growth of their teeth during the developmental stage. However, if the toothpaste's ingredients do not comply with the standards, it would affect dental and oral health despite good oral care habits, said Nora Tam, chairwoman of the council's research and testing committee.

She also advised parents to accompany their younger children when they are brushing their teeth, to prevent them from swallowing the toothpaste mistakenly. 

Separately, the consumer watchdog reminded people to cut down on seaweed, saying most products are high in iodine and eating too much can cause thyroid problems. 

The watchdog tested 27 seaweed samples and found that all of them contained a large amount of iodine. 

In one product by Baby Basic, the iodine level exceeded the recommended daily intake for toddlers by 90 percent.

Meanwhile, 70 percent of the seaweed products were found to be high in sodium and 40 percent of them high in fat. 

The council's chief executive, Gilly Wong, urged people not to rely on seaweed as a major source of fibre. 

Please don't use seaweed to replace vegetables. Because some people have a very busy lifestyle, and occasionally they just think seaweed is also very high in fibre, and they can use seaweed to replace regular vegetables. That may not be the best way to absorb [fibre], she said.";Radio Television Hong Kong

Speaking a day after the opening of the party's 20th national congress, Tam explained that the Covid 19 pandemic is still fluctuating with the emergence of more infectious variants, and there's a need to avoid major outbreaks. 

Just because we hope for an immediate border reopening after the 20th party congress ends, that doesn't mean it would happen. This is just not realistic, Tam,who is Hong Kong's sole delegate to the country's top legislative body, told an RTHK programme. 

However, he also pointed out that research on homegrown booster vaccines and Covid antivirals are under way, and the availability of these drugs can help bring the idea of border reopening closer to reality. 

Tam said while there will be some changes for sure in terms of border measures after the party congress, it will take time for mainland officials to prepare for the adjustments. 

He said he hopes authorities there will increase the quota to allow more Hong Kong residents to cross the border.

Winds with mean speeds of between 41 and 62 kilometres an hour are expected. People are warned to ensure that objects likely to be blown away are securely fastened or taken indoors, and they should stay away from the shoreline and not engage in water sports.

At about 4.45pm, the storm was at its closest to Hong Kong, skirting about 400 kilometres southeast of the territory. The Observatory says that, unless Nesat takes a more northerly track or intensifies significantly, the likelihood of it issuing the number 8 gale or storm signal before midnight is not high.

The Observatory said winds were also expected to strengthen during the day, under the effects of Nesat and the northeast monsoon. It said temperatures were expected to fall appreciably on Tuesday.

Classes of kindergartens and schools for children with physical or intellectual disability have been suspended for the day.

Writing on social media, Lee said the One Country, Two Systems principle – along with Hong Kong and Macau – were mentioned numerous times in the speech, adding Xi's remarks on the implementation of the principle were spot on and would serve as a pillar of Hong Kong's development.

The CE noted that the territory had in the past five years faced the hardest challenges since the handover, but it always had the support of the country, both during the social unrest in 2019 and the pandemic.

Lee said as Hong Kong is turning a new page after the central government helped to restore order here, he will be proposing more measures for economic development and improving people's livelihoods in his maiden Policy Address on Wednesday.

The call was among a raft of measures proposed by the Society for Community Organisation (SoCO), which petitioned outside the government headquarters in Tamar on Sunday. 

Sze Lai shan, the society's deputy director, said the pandemic has made life very difficult for those who work or have families across the border in the past few years.

It's related to their job. Some of them even have their materials on the mainland. With the [restricted] border, it's really hard to transport the materials and they cannot work, she said.

They have some elderly family [members] on the mainland, they are sick and they need to take care of them. Actually they're very concerned whether the border will be opened. If the border is closed and they need to be quarantined, they don't have money to pay for the hotel. There are many difficulties. 

Sze also urged the chief executive to address the housing needs of low income families, such as boosting public housing supply and shortening the waiting time, and set up a key performance indicator (KPI).

We are concerned with the needs of the underprivileged. Many of them are living in subdivided flats, and the living condition is very poor.

He said the authorities could combine some of the units there into larger flats for bigger families, and the conversion of the entire facility would only take about three months.

Chua said he hopes the Kai Tak camp would provide transitional housing for up to five years, if there's no other plan for the site in the near future.

We really need more transitional housing, especially those in the city centre. With this provision I would expect more grassroot people living in subdivided units could move into transitional housing earlier, he said.

The president and party general secretary made the remarks in a speech marking the start of the 20th Communist Party Congress in Beijing.

In the face of turbulent developments in Hong Kong, the central government exercised overall jurisdiction over the special administrative region as prescribed by China's constitution and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and ensured Hong Kong is administered by patriots, he said.

Thanks to these moves, order has been restored in Hong Kong, marking a major turn for the better in the region.

We have helped Hong Kong enter a new stage in which it has restored order and is set to strive.

He highlighted the successful implementation of the One Country, Two Systems principle under which the people of Hong Kong and Macau administer the respective SARs with a high degree of autonomy.

The policy of One Country, Two Systems is a great innovation of socialism with Chinese characteristics... This policy must be adhered to over the long term, he said.

Xi added that Beijing will support Hong Kong and Macau in better integrating themselves into China's overall development.

On Taiwan, Xi said, We have resolutely fought against separatism and countered interference, demonstrating our resolve and ability to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and to oppose 'Taiwan independence'.

'We will continue to strive for peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and the utmost effort, but we will never promise to renounce the use of force, and we reserve the option of taking all measures necessary. This is directed solely at interference by outside forces and the few separatists seeking 'Taiwan independence' and their separatist activities; it is by no means targeted at our Taiwan compatriots.'

He added that an overall policy framework has been put forward to resolve the Taiwan question, and cross strait exchanges and cooperation have been facilitated. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

Since our positioning is different, I am not worried of so called competition, because competition will only alert and remind us to do better and be more hardworking. I think Singapore is more positioned towards Asia and other regions.

But the Chinese University professor stressed that people need not be overly concerned about this, because the SAR has a high vaccination rate and the jabs are effective against new variants. 

Speaking to reporters after appearing on a radio programme, Hui said the real time virus reproductive number currently stands at around 1.27, meaning cases can be expected to rise for the time being.

If you look at the statistics, the number of severe cases and fatal cases is actually not that high, and quite similar to [that in] Singapore....We actually don't need to worry too much, he said.

Hui added that quite a number of people in Hong Kong have hybrid immunity because of recent infections.

The professor of respiratory medicine said he believes the public gathering cap should certainly be relaxed from groups of four to twelve – as is being considered by the government – because tables of 12 are already allowed at restaurants.

However, he said the government's vaccine pass and PCR tests for inbound travellers should be kept in place.

If you don't perform PCR, you can't perform genome sequencing – you can't monitor new variants coming in to Hong Kong, he said, adding that officials want to be cautious about the variants, at least for now.

Deputy Chief Ambulance Officer Kwok Kin Man told a press conference that the four rebuilt buses will help speed up the time it takes to transfer residential care home residents by two to three times.

He said normal ambulances can only carry up to two bedridden patients but the new rigs can carry four.

'If we don't use these vehicles, the ambulance used will need to have another two, three, or even four trips.'

Kwok said that's important as the quarantine and isolation facilities the patients are taken to are often relatively far away, such as the Asia World Expo on Lantau Island.

He said since the start of the fifth wave of the pandemic until the end of last month, fire services handled more than 1,500 care home evacuations, and moved about 5,300 residents. 

At the peak period, the department was moving about 100 residents a day, Kwok said. 

Senior ambulance man Tse Chung Kang told reporters about an operation to move residents of a Sha Tau Kok care home to Asia World Expo that lasted about nine hours. This, he said, involved officers carrying the elderly people in wheelchairs down the stairs one by one.

When asked why the modification project had only been launched about two years into the pandemic, the deputy ambulance chief said the department regularly reviews all projects, and that the Covid situation had fluctuated.

File image: Shutterstock Researchers say many elderly members of Hong Kong's South Asian community are struggling with language barriers, leaving them in difficulty when seeking medical treatment and unsure of how to access financial support, with matters made worse by the pandemic. 

A team from the Metropolitan University made the findings in a study based on interviews with 58 Indian, Nepalese and Pakistani people aged 60 and above between May 2021 and July this year. Many of the interviewees could neither speak nor read English or Cantonese, making life inconvenient and leaving them reliant on help from younger relatives. 

Terence Shum, an assistant professor who led the research, said the problem was particularly acute for those who had to visit public hospitals. Some found that translation services were suspended at times during the Covid pandemic, and even though interpreters are now available again, interviewees were not always confident in the translation.

'Some of them expressed that the interpreters didn't translate the language correctly, because sometimes maybe they [the participants] understand a little bit of English or Cantonese,' Shum said.

'So they will just go with their children or grandchildren to seek medical advice, but some of them will say: well, it's difficult to match the medical appointment with the working schedule of the children and grandchildren. So some of them will just forget about the appointment or postpone it.'

Meanwhile, Shum also said many of the participants faced a difficult financial situation, and the language barrier made it harder for them to access financial support.

'Hong Kong Chinese older adults would know how to get additional information to apply for financial assistance from NGOs or the government. But South Asian older adults may not have this knowledge or gain access to this kind of information from different official resources,' he explained.

Shum said some participants relied on help from their children, who may have lost jobs during the pandemic.

He called on the government to cooperate with NGOs or associations representing ethnic minorities to provide professional training and support and build up interpretation services at public hospitals. He also suggested that training could be given to the children of older South Asian adults to help them as caregivers.

In response to an RTHK enquiry, a Hospital Authority (HA) spokesperson said interpretation service had never been suspended during the pandemic, adding that relevant guidelines are in place to ensure service quality. 

To ensure the quality of interpretation service at public hospitals and clinics, the HA provides through its interpretation service contractor training for all interpreters on general knowledge about the operation of hospitals and clinics, medical terminologies and infection control, so that interpreters can provide interpretation services for users of diverse race in a prompt and accurate manner, the spokesperson said.

Photo: RTHK The man who launched a legal challenge to the government's attempt to invalidate 20,000 vaccine exemption certificates said on Friday he was appealing against a decision to deny him legal aid in the case. 

Kwok Cheuk kin, known as the king of judicial reviews because of his frequent legal challenges, will be back in the High Court on Thursday for a full hearing after Justice Russell Coleman this week granted an interim relief order blocking the cancellation of certificates issued by seven doctors suspected of giving out the papers improperly.

However the Legal Aid Department earlier blocked Kwok's application for public funds in the case on the grounds that he is not directly affected because he has received three doses of the Covid vaccine.

Speaking to reporters on Friday, Kwok said he should receive legal aid as the case involves public interest. He noted that he had received legal aid for an earlier challenge to the small house policy, under which male indigenous villagers are allowed to build homes on private or public land, despite not being directly affected. 

Kwok also revealed that a woman who holds an exemption certificate may join him in his legal fight. However, he pointed out that the woman's waiver was not issued by one of the seven doctors whose certificates are earmarked for cancellation. 

The certificates allow people who are not fully vaccinated to enter premises such as restaurants. Government lawyers argue that the invalidation is justified on public health grounds and say that people affected can visit another doctor, including free public doctors, to seek a new exemption certificate.

Officials revealed on Thursday that they were mulling increasing the limit on the size of public gatherings from the present four to 12, and Lo faced questions at a Legislative Council panel meeting on the rationale for keeping the gathering limit in place, given that up to 12 people can sit together to eat in a restaurant.

'We have to consider the restriction of 599G, and we have to amend the legislation in order to relax the relevant measures, unlike how we do every two weeks when we relax other measures,' Lo said said in response to a question from lawmaker Rebecca Chan.

'We have to stick to the relevant procedures to amend the legislation,' Lo stressed.

However Lo said officials were determined to work towards easing the cap on public gatherings, adding that the government followed the principle of consistency in implementing its anti Covid strategy.

Meanwhile medical experts Wilson Lam and Ho Pak Leung told separate radio interviews on Friday that the government could go further and scrap the limit on public gatherings entirely,given that limits were in place for the size of groups in premises such as restaurants.

Image: Shutterstock Scientific experts advising the government on Thursday recommended that authorities should bring in a new generation of Covid vaccine that targets Omicron variants. 

The experts pointed out that the BioNTech bivalent vaccine, which targets the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 variants, may trigger broader immunity against different strains compared to the original version. 

They recommended that the new vaccine can serve as an alternative to the booster shot for those aged 12 or above. 

The members of the Centre for Health Protection's Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases and the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Zoonotic Diseases came to the conclusion after holding a meeting on Thursday afternoon. 

One of the experts, David Hui from the Chinese University, had earlier said he expected Hong Kong may get the new generation booster vaccine in January at the earliest. 

Meanwhile, the experts also concluded that the recommendation that an eight week gap between the first and second dose of BioNTech for children aged six months to five years should be kept. It said the third jab for this age group should only be given at least three months after the second.

They explained this would reduce the risk of heart inflammation, but added the dosing interval between the first two jabs could be shortened to a minimum of three weeks for those with personal needs.

The return of live performances in places such as pubs on October 20 comes after months of calls from performers and operators, who say they've seen their incomes suffer even as large scale gigs have been allowed to resume.

Performers will have to take regular Covid tests, including presenting a negative rapid antigen test at the venue on the day of the performance. They must keep masks on where possible and maintain a distance from the audience. 

Announcing the changes, Undersecretary for Health Libby Lee said the government was also actively considering easing the cap on public gatherings from the present limit of four people to 12.

[Limiting] the number of people gathering together is one of the useful measures to limit the spread of the disease. Once the disease is controlled, or all the immunity of the public is guaranteed, basically we can slowly release the limitations of the number of people in gatherings, Lee said.

But how [quickly] it should be, or what number it should be, I think it's actually tied to the same principle of observing the effect of each relaxation of measures. When you see the relaxation of measures, the risk of infections can be controlled, and there will be space to further relax.

In another change, people will be allowed to eat in outdoor areas of theme parks, instead of being limited to food premises within the attractions.

The announcement came as the SAR on Thursday reported 5,622 new Covid infections, including 387 imported ones. Eight more patients with Covid have died.

Health officials said they recorded 23 more cases involving the new Covid subvariant XBB, bringing the tally in the territory to 29.

Albert Au from the Centre for Health Protection said while the new subvariant could be more transmissible, there is no scientific evidence to indicate that it will lead to more severe infections. 

If this subvariant is imported into Hong Kong, there is a risk of replacing the BA.5 currently circulating in the local community. We will closely monitor the situation. According to overseas experiences, especially the Singapore experience, when this subvariant, the proportion is increasing, there will also be an increase in the proportion of infections, and also an increase in the absolute number of cases, Au said.

However, so far there is no scientific evidence showing that this type of new subvariant has an increased disease severity, or causes more severe disease once infected.

Separately, the Hospital Authority said it has resumed more than 80 percent of its non emergency services, and is relaxing its visiting restrictions for 10 psychiatric hospitals and wards starting next week. 

From next Thursday, patients at lower risks of infection – including those under 60 or individuals who are at least double jabbed, will be given a one hour visit each day, with a quota of three registered visitors for each session. 

Patients at higher risks of infection, such as those with compromised immune systems, will be allowed two one hour visits each week, and up to two visitors can register for each slot.

File photo: RTHK RTHK learned on Thursday that a government appointed committee has proposed raising the statutory minimum wage in Hong Kong from HK$37.5 to HK$40 per hour.

The 6.7 percent hike is expected to come into force in May next year upon the Executive Council's approval.

Reacting to the news, labour sector lawmaker Chau Siu chung, of the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions, said some workers told him they are happy with the increase after the minimum wage has remained steady since 2019, but are disappointed that it barely catches up with inflation.

Chau said the sector hopes the Minimum Wage Commission could propose raising the minimum wage to HK$46 per hour.

Another labour group, the Federation of Trade Unions, said it reluctantly agreed to the increase after a freeze last year, adding the government should revise the mechanism that determines the minimum wage and revisit the level every year, instead of every two years.

A member of the Labour Advisory Board representing employers, Jimmy Kwok, said the increase is in line with inflation and believes sectors such as catering and retail will find it acceptable.

The Minimum Wage Commission is expected to submit its proposal later this month.

DAB lawmaker Frankie Ngan said he's not so much concerned about the actual wage level but how it is calculated. 

He urged the government to calculate the minimum wage with a standard formula that takes into account factors such as inflation and median wage. 

'It will be objective, and it is useful for the business sector and the labour sector to perceive what the minimum wage level is, and it will reduce the uncertainty for the labour market,' he said.

The study, led by the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups, was based on data analysis by researchers to assess trends and view rates of drug related posts on social media. 

It found that the number of drug related posts on platforms from Hong Kong has increased threefold from around 900 in 2016 to more than 3,000 last year. 

Researchers said many online users had used popular memes, hashtags and non fungible tokens (NFT) to promote drug use. An NFT is a one off digital asset, often in the form of an artwork or cartoon, that can't be copied. Their details are kept on the blockchain and they've become popular with collectors in recent years.

We found some NFT in the high risk websites. Some high risk users often use memes, hashtags, animated characters and NFT to promote drugs. It causes some users to underestimate the risks and severity of drug abuse problem, said Michael Leung of the group's youth crime prevention centre. 

Meanwhile, the group also polled around 1,300 younger adults from last November to July this year, and found that around 20 percent of them had underestimated the harm of drugs.

Leung said many youngsters had misconceptions about drug use, believing for example, that they are able to fight off any drug cravings, or that drug taking is purely a personal choice.

District Court judge Frankie Yiu said Wong Kwan wa was among 300 people who took part in a protest, which turned into a 10 minute riot, on July 1, 2020, less than 24 hours after the national security law took effect in Hong Kong.

The court heard that Wong, 26, stabbed the officer in the left arm with a folding knife outside Sogo department store when the policeman was trying to subdue Law Kok sum, another defendant in the case. 

Hours after the assault, Wong boarded a plane bound for the United Kingdom, but was arrested by the police before it took off. 

He had earlier pleaded guilty to taking part in a riot and wounding the officer with intent.

In mitigation, Wong's lawyer said he was born to a poor family and had worked hard to achieve what he had. The lawyer said Wong was kind and loving, and was not a leader in the protest, but made a big mistake out of recklessness.

Sentencing Wong, the judge noted the injury could have cost the officer his life, adding that his career development had also been affected because he had since been deployed to handle administrative work.

The judge said the case was of a serious nature, but said he had taken into account Wong's guilty plea and his clear criminal record.

That's according to Lau Yu lung, who is also the chair professor of paediatrics at the University of Hong Kong. 

He noted that the World Health Organisation has advised people to have a four  to eight week window between the first and second shots to provide better protection while reducing the likelihood of heart muscle inflammation – a side effect associated with the jab. 

'Hong Kong is one of the first places which warned that the heart muscle inflammation [caused by the BioNTech shots] is not so rare, so we are very sensitive about this,' he said. 

On Wednesday, Health Secretary Lo Chung mau approved the emergency use of the infant and children BioNTech formula in Hong Kong, but said there's no timetable yet on when the vaccines will be shipped to the city. 

'Hong Kong's epidemic situation had been improving, but the number of cases seems to be going up again. So, it's a dilemma. Perhaps we will advise a certain extent of flexibility after today's meeting. We'll see. But Hong Kong always puts safety first,' Lau said.

Speaking at a summit organised by the British Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, Lee said the SAR's international connectivity was close to his heart and that he was acutely aware of the concerns of the community and the business sector on the pace of opening up, but he stressed that public health remained a key priority. 

Why do we have to be careful in managing risks? Two reasons. First, we have to protect our high risk population, especially the elderly and the very young. We are talking about human lives here. We cannot afford to do nothing, Lee said.

We want to reduce the number of critical cases and fatalities as much as we can. Second, we must do our utmost to ensure that our public health system would not be overwhelmed. Our hospitals must continue to provide adequate and efficient healthcare services to the people of Hong Kong.

But Lee told delegates that they could look to some exciting moments in the months ahead, with representatives of more than 100 major financial institutions expected for next month's Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit, and the return of the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens.

Photo courtesy of Orbis A charity which focuses on eye care said Hong Kong people have not been paying enough attention to their eye health, after its survey found that more than half of respondents had never checked their eyes. 

Orbis and the Hong Kong Ophthalmological Society surveyed 6,253 locals last month, and found that more than half of them had never had their eyes checked. 

The survey also found that 40 percent of the respondents had medium or high risk of catching eye diseases, but almost half of them had never done an eye test either.

Emmy Li, the society's vice president and a volunteer doctor at Orbis, described the situation as worrying. 

I think the main reason is that, many people thought that if they are seeing okay, seeing fine, then they don't need an eye check up. But in fact that is not the case, because there are many eye diseases that in the early stage, the symptom is not that obvious.

Meanwhile, 20 percent of respondents said they believe rubbing their eyes could help soothe discomfort, but Li said this is a misconception and may cause infection. 

If you rub your eyes a lot, there's risk that your hands are not clean enough, and you're introducing bacteria and germs and causing eye infection. Sometimes the more you rub, the more itchy that you feel. 

The doctor called on people not to ignore symptoms like flashes and floaters, saying they could be symptoms of more serious eye diseases. 

This is particularly worrying, because if you have floaters or flashes, it means that there's a possibility that you have some retinal problems, she said. 

In the worst case it can be an early symptom of retinal detachment, which is a blinding disease. So I think if individuals experience floaters or flashers, it is very needed that they should go to an eye check up by a specialist. 

The survey also found that younger adults are less likely to check their eyes, with only one third of respondents aged between 20 and 29 said they had done a comprehensive eye test. 

It's likely because teenagers usually see very well. They don't have a blurring vision and it's less likely that their eyes get dry, she said. 

Li called on people of all age groups to check their eyes regularly, to make sure they don't have hidden diseases.

At present, the BioNTech shot is only given to those aged five and above, while the Sinovac jab was made available for younger children in August.

The administration said in a statement that the health secretary considered the paediatric and toddler formulation of the BioNTech vaccine to fulfil the criteria of safety, efficacy and quality for emergency use in Hong Kong, after taking into account the views from experts on a government appointed advisory panel.

The experts agreed the benefits of using the jab outweigh its risks.

In mitigation, counsel for Mak quoted the defendant's former boss as saying that he had always performed well at work, and that the incident came amid a manpower shortage at the school that day.

Passing sentence, magistrate Jason Wan said that even though the charge was not serious, it did involve a breach of good faith.

The Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union announced the new minimum pay scales after talks with members, contractors' groups and others in the sector. 

Plasterers will see pay increase by 12.5 percent while installers of false ceilings will get 12 percent and metal and marble workers will see pay increases of 7.7 percent. Other workers will get pay rises of at least 3 percent, though bar benders and concrete and excavation workers will continue to see their wages frozen. 

The union's chairman, Wong Ping, said the pay increases were mild and not ideal, but acknowledged that employers cannot pay higher salaries as they have to stick to budgets that are based on tenders won years ago. 

Yet Wong said the pay rise alone would not be enough to attract workers to the sector, adding that labour was in short supply after construction activity surged as the pandemic eased.

The union also called on the government to set standards for developers on the timescale for construction projects, saying a survey of members had found strong backing for the idea as a way of easing pressure to complete work quickly.

The group said it questioned 1,470 members in August and September on the matter and found that 83 percent backed the call.

'A few years ago, developers required us to construct a storey in six or seven days. But now they require us to complete it in three or four days,' said Ho Ping tak, the union's conference development officer.

'The construction period is not reasonable. When workers plateau, accidents occur easily.'

As an example of the pressure workers were under, Tak cited an industrial accident in Yau Tong in August when work continued after the typhoon signal No 3 was issued. Three workers were injured.";Radio Television Hong Kong

The calls follow a decision by a school in Tsuen Wan to suspend 14 pupils for three days after they failed to turn up for the raising of the national flag.

Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Mervyn Cheung, the chairman of the Hong Kong Education Policy Concern Organisation, said the punishment imposed by St Francis Xavier's School was drastic, and said suspending pupils should be a last resort.

I think the EDB (Education Bureau) should consider revising the circular that it issued last year and be more specific with the penalties for non compliance, he told RTHK's Ben Tse.

He said that the severity of any punishment could be based on factors such as whether the pupils were being negligent or whether their actions were deliberate. 

Lawmaker Tang Fei, who is also a secondary school principal, echoed Cheung's call for clarity on the matter of penalties. 

Speaking on another RTHK programme, Tang said this could help schools avoid giving the impression that class suspensions may be too harsh.

He defended the decision by St Francis Xavier's School, saying that it had followed the necessary protocols. 

It had stated clearly and taught its students on what should be done during a flag raising ceremony, said Tang, adding that the school had informed the pupils' parents and the Education Bureau in accordance with guidelines after the incident. 

He said that schools should not be left to decide on what penalties to hand out, pointing out that there are laws governing the treatment of violations linked to the national flag, emblem and anthem.

The Education Bureau said on Monday that it was seeking a report on the incident from the school. It said there are clear rules governing etiquette during the national anthem and flag raising ceremony.";Radio Television Hong Kong

Speaking on Tuesday at a forum on the SAR's development, Leung said while the further relaxation of Covid travel rules is an important factor for bringing investors back to Hong Kong, it is not the only issue that matters. 

The vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference said while many Hongkongers hope that investors will return to the city after officials bring in the 'zero plus zero' policy, that won't be enough as overseas firms and key opinion leaders tend to have misunderstandings about Hong Kong. 

Not only do they not know [enough about Hong Kong], they have plenty of misunderstandings or superficial knowledge. Or they were misled, because of smearing campaigns by overseas media and politicians about what's really happening in Hong Kong, Leung said.

The former CE also said people need to be aware that Hong Kong is facing more opportunities than challenges as the country undergoes major changes. 

But he said to tap into the country's development momentum, Hong Kong needs to address a number of issues, namely people not knowing enough about the country's development, mainland firms not knowing about the SAR's advantages and overseas businesses knowing too little about Hong Kong's actual situation. 

The state leader added that Hong Kong ranks fourth in a recently released United Nations Human Development Index, which measures people's health, knowledge and standard of living in different countries and regions.

Photo: RTHK A High Court judge has put on hold the invalidation by the government of some 20,000 Covid 19 vaccination exemption certificates issued by seven private doctors, pending a legal challenge.

Justice Russell Coleman on Tuesday issued an interim relief order to that effect until a judicial review hearing next week.

The application for the legal challenge was filed by Kwok Cheuk kin, the so called king of judicial reviews, who said the government should not nullify the exemption certificates before they are found to have been issued improperly by the doctors.

At a case management hearing at the High Court, government lawyers representing Secretary for Health Lo Chung mau said he had ordered that the certificates be invalidated to protect public health, as it would effectively ban their holders from entering restaurants and other premises.

They also said those affected by the move could consult another doctor to obtain a new exemption certificate, and could even see a government doctor for free.

The certificates were supposed to be invalidated from Wednesday. 

Justice Coleman said he made the decision mainly because the judicial review hearing would take place imminently, on Thursday next week.

Kwok welcomed the judge's decision. Hong Kong is a society [governed by] the rule of law... If the seven [doctors] were found not guilty by the court, and the vaccination exemption certificates were invalidated, who can compensate [those affected]? he told reporters outside court.";Radio Television Hong Kong

Before Tuesday, tourists visiting Japan needed to arrange a visa in advance and join organised tour groups. Since Tokyo announced it was easing the rules, airlines have been adding extra flights from the SAR to serve expected strong demand.

One family of three heading to Fukuoka said they expected to spend about 400,000 yen, or $21,500, on their three day trip, and the father of the family said he couldn't wait to create lasting memories with his daughter.

'I'm excited, I haven't travelled [to Japan] for too long, I couldn't sleep well last night  I will bring her [my daughter] to the zoo and to try on a kimono,' he said.

Another woman who was heading to Osaka with her husband said: 'We've brought around 600,000 to 700,000 yen. [We'll] play hard and shop hard. Our last trip is already in February 2020.

'I've prepared an empty suitcase [for shopping] and added 20kg luggage allowance  I want to buy everything,' she added.

Hong Kong people made more than two million visits to Japan in 2019, according to figures from the Japan National Tourism Organisation.

The CEO of Hong Kong Express, Mandy Ng, told reporters that the easing of border curbs both in Hong Kong and Japan had encouraged independent travellers to plan their journeys, with flights to all Japanese cities on Tuesday very full. 

'We have opened all the check in counters  we can see an enthusiastic market response after the zero plus three arrangement is announced,' She said, referring to the SAR government's decision to end hotel quarantine for incoming travellers. 

Ng added that the airline would increase the number of weekly flights to Japan from about 50 this month to 120 during the peak travel season in December, with a popular route to Tokyo Haneda Airport to be restored.

She said that by the end of March, the airline planned to run 460 flights a week, similar to pre pandemic levels.

The airline announced previously that it was cancelling or rescheduling a number of flights in the coming months, angering some travellers who had booked seats. Asked about the decision, Ng said only that it was made after a 'comprehensive review'.

'We notice that people, in general, are planning more advance for their travel compared to pre Covid times. That's why we have conducted a comprehensive review on our flight schedule next year in order to give a more transparent outlook to our flight schedule so travelers can make their travel plan ahead,' Ng said.

Ng stressed that most of the affected flights had only been rescheduled, not cancelled, and all the affected passengers had been notified and offered a full refund.";Radio Television Hong Kong

The so called sanction imposed on people in Hong Kong without justification, it is a very barbaric act. And I'm not going to comment on the effect of such a barbaric act, because officials in Hong Kong do what is right to protect the interests of the country and the interests of Hong Kong. So we will just laugh off the so called sanctions, he told reporters ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting.

On a superyacht berthed in the SAR that is tied to a Russian businessman sanctioned by western countries, Lee said, We cannot do and will not do anything that has no legal basis.

The 56 year old oligarch, Alexey Mordashov, has been the target of sanctions from the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States amid the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

But the CE made it clear Hong Kong will comply with United Nations sanctions. In Hong Kong, we will respect the rule of law, and we will do anything when there is a legal basis.

We will comply with any United Nations resolution on sanctions, because Hong Kong has the legal basis to enforce it  that is our system, that is our rule of law.

On a government move to put on hold plans to enact Article 23 of the Basic Law, Lee said there's a need to be more cautious when dealing with this piece of legislation. 

In terms of national security, risks are ever changing, and we see rapid deterioration in geopolitics. In the past, we never imagined that some measures can be used to attack another country to threaten its national security. Against that background, we must be able to legislate an effective piece of legislation that can tackle extreme circumstances. Therefore, the legislation must be thorough and in depth, Lee said.

We do not want to come out with a piece of legislation with loopholes, requiring us to review it again too soon.

He made the comment a day after Hong Kong reported two imported cases involving the two new Covid strains.

Speaking on a radio programme, the expert said XBB.1 is likely to replace the current BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants as the dominant strain.

But he said this should not be too much of a concern, as the current vaccines offered in Hong Kong are effective against the subvariant. 

He added that people should not wait for the second generation vaccine – which targets the BA.4 and BA.5 strains – as it would likely become 'out of date' by the time it's available in the city. 

By the time we get the second generation vaccine by the end of this year or early next year, the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants will be history. It will be outdated, Lau said.

Although part of the samples is still being examined, others are found negative for the bacteria. A total of 29 Melioidosis cases were reported by Health Authorities this year, with 20 originating from Sham Shui Po and 17 logged between August and October. 'All the patients went to restaurants and other dining premises, but no overlap was found in their movement paths, and their close contacts showed no disease symptoms,' said health officers, claiming the infection opportunities via food can be ruled out. Besides, the city's leading microbiologist Yuen Kwok yung said 31 environmental samples were collected from residential places of the infected by his medical team, among which only two samples, coming from the same patient, were found carrying bacteria. 'Yet the bacteria level is extremely low,' he said, 'thus we thought it might not be the source but rather be the contamination left by the bacteria carried by the patient.' He added that chlorine in the household water supply system can destroy the bacteria. 'The Water Supplies Department has reviewed the water supply system in the district and maintenance records for the past three months,' Yuen said, noting no malfunction or damage. Melioidosis is a bacterial disease, also known as Whitmore's disease, which causes nonspecific symptoms such as fever, joint pain, and headaches, but can also cause pneumonia, abscess formation, and blood infections. The disease can be treated with antibiotics; however, long term treatment may be necessary for some chronic infection cases. The mortality rate of the illness ranges from around 40 75 percent.

Li Tim chuen, the defendant, earlier pleaded guilty to two counts of throwing corrosive fluid with intent to do grievous bodily harm after he admitted to attacking four employees in the care center where he lived. The attack was allegedly perpetrated out of revenge after the care home failed to return his deposit. During the sentencing in the High Court on Tuesday morning, Justice Andrew Chan Hing wai slammed the defendant's actions of intentionally harming innocent people as 'heinous' and causing permanent injuries. According to the court, Li lived at Pak Ho Gerocomy Center between June 2018 to August 2019. He failed to notify the care home in advance and moved out from the place, which led to the home withholding Li's deposit of HK$8,200. Li, failing to get the deposit back after asking multiple times, brought several bottles of acid to the reception counter of the care home at around 12 pm on January 25, 2020, the court was told, where he sprayed the liquid on four employees who were dining at the scene. The court heard the four victims were seriously injured, one of whom was burned over her face, and seven percent of her body, and one was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder after the accident. Li's defense said in mitigation that leniency could be shown given his age, but the judge dismissed the contention, pointing out Li planned well to try to cause severe harm to others. During the hearing, Li suddenly screamed in the court that he was 'defrauded' by the care home who failed to pay back his deposit, which led the judge to adjourn the court for ten minutes. Li was previously sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of murder in 2000 over the stabbing and killing of a female employee of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department but was released on bail in 2018, after which he moved to the care home.

The netizen surnamed Yip shared on Facebook Sunday a picture of a long scar and the stitches on his left palm after being attacked by the mantis shrimp. He told netizens he was wearing oyster shucking gloves and was trying to grab the shrimp for some photos at the time. He also said he had been discharged from the hospital already. According to Yip's photos, the shrimp was as long as his forearm. Yip hoped his experience could serve as a reminder for other seafood lovers to exercise caution. Many wished Yip a speedy recovery and recalled similar incidents they had heard of. According to the Centre for Health Protection, having an open wound exposed to seawater and consuming raw or undercooked seafood contaminated with vibrio vulnificus – a bacteria present naturally in warm seawater – may result in necrotizing fasciitis, commonly known as 'flesh eating infection.' In June 2012, the CHP recorded two deaths related to infections of vibrio vulnificus. Both deceased patients suffered from chronic diseases, and one had eaten raw mantis shrimp. In Hong Kong, the case fatality rate of vibrio vulnificus associated necrotising fasciitis is about 30 percent, the CHP said. Appropriate antibiotics given promptly are needed to kill the bacteria. In order to stop the 'flesh eating infection' from spreading, surgery, such as the removal of dead tissue or amputation of the limb, may be required. Some patients may require intensive care. The CHP called on citizens to be careful with sharp parts of seafood and wear protective gloves when handling raw shellfish or other seafood. The public should also avoid skin contact with dirty water when visiting a wet market, clean wounds immediately, and cover them properly with waterproof adhesive dressings until healed.

Lee, a former career police officer with limited financial expertise, will have the challenging task of lifting Hong Kong's regional competitiveness after its economy shrank 1.3 percent in the second quarter. Covid 19 restrictions have hit the China ruled city hard since early 2020, battering shops and restaurants, bringing tourism to a halt, and stoking an exodus of expatriates. Lee, speaking to reporters on Tuesday, emphasized a need for Hong Kong to relaunch itself, citing a recent speech by Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who said Beijing would help Hong Kong 'resolve deep seated issues and problems in economic and social development' and consolidate its 'international position' in finance, trade and other areas. 'We are now embarking on a new chapter for further prosperity, and this is a new phase for Hong Kong,' Lee said. 'Hong Kong has emerged from chaos to order, and now we're moving from order to prosperity,' added Lee, referring to pro democracy demonstrations in 2019. Beijing responded to the protests with a sweeping national security law in 2020, prompting an exodus of Hong Kong residents to countries including Britain, that offered 'lifeboat' citizenship schemes in response to the law.

A part time worker surnamed Wong was crushed to death by falling pallets of bricks while assisting in moving the bricks as cargo at the New Yau Ma Tei Public Cargo Working Area in Tai Kok Tsui at around 4pm yesterday afternoon. During the accident, the nylon rope that held the pallet of bricks was suspected of having broken as Wong was helping to lift them, causing the bricks to come loose and fall, crushing him. Wong was to move out of the way in time and was struck multiple times, sustaining injuries all over his body. He was then rushed to the hospital but certified dead later in the night. More than ten of Wong's family members attended the Kwai Chung Public Mortuary to identify his body on Tuesday morning. Wong's elder brother said the deceased worked at a logistics company and had a part time job at the industrial site. The father of Wong questioned his son's employer for putting him to work without abiding by safety codes. 'He was not provided with a safety helmet by the company when he was working,' said the father. According to his elder brother, Wong was the family breadwinner and lived with his father and younger brother in a residential flat in Tin Shui Wai.

According to Lam Kai shan, senior inspector of the customs' cargo examination unit, officers inspected an air cargo consignment, declared as carrying transformers, arriving from Mexico en route to Australia via Hong Kong at the airport. Yet, officers raised their suspicions after an X ray scanning, which revealed the poor structure of the transformers and missing parts, including coils. Officers also found signs of welding and uneven painting on the surface of the transformers, drawing speculations that the transformers were not the products of some big brands. The recipient was an Australian company, but the cargo was addressed to a house, which was not a commercial correspondence. It took officers around two hours to unpack the cargo and unscrew the three transformers, only to find 45 bags of suspected methamphetamine weighing around 76 kg within, with an estimated value of HK$46 million. Lam said the drug syndicate took advantage of the complicated structure of the transformers and carefully hid the drugs inside to confuse law enforcement officers. Leung Kwok wai, a senior investigator of the customs' drug investigation bureau, said it is the third case of its kind busted in Hong Kong this year, where the drugs are hidden in electrical transformers sent as cargo from South America. He continued customs seized 3.4 tons of drugs from January until now, seeing an 8 percent increase compared with the 3.15 tons recorded in the same period last year. Methamphetamine, commonly known as 'ice,' accounts for the majority, with about 1.1 tons seized. Customs said investigations are ongoing. They warned trafficking in dangerous drugs is a serious offense, and the maximum penalty upon conviction carries a HK$5 million fine and life imprisonment.

Under Hong Kong's 'Producer Responsibility Scheme', sellers are required to provide free, government approved removal services for old and unwanted electric appliances to customers who buy new products of the same type. Air conditioners, refrigerators, washing machines, televisions, computers, printers, scanners and monitors will have to be taken to a licensed recycler to process and store them. Producers also have to pay a recycling levy of between HK$15 and HK$165 per item to the government every quarter. The new plan will see clothes dryers and dehumidifiers included in the scheme, with a charge of HK$125 per item   the same as the charge for washing machines and air conditioning units. Meanwhile, the list of regulated electrical equipment will also be updated to include refrigerators with a total storage volume of up to 900 liters and washing machines with a rated washing capacity of up to 15kg. Authorities noted that since the scheme's implementation in 2018, recyclers have processed over 90,000 tons of regulated e waste as of June this year.

No. 3 Tropical Cyclone Warning signal was called off at 3.40 pm, after lasting for 28 hours since 11.30 am yesterday. At 3 pm, Typhoon Nesat was estimated to be about 500 kilometres south southwest of Hong Kong and is forecast to move west southwest at about 15 kilometres per hour towards the seas south of Hainan Island. The weather watchdog said although Nesat has departed from the coast of Guangdong, under the influence of the intense northeast monsoon, it remains windy over the territory with strong winds offshore and occasional gale winds on high ground. Seas will still be rough with swells and citizens are advised to stay away from the shoreline and not to engage in water sports, it added.

Speaking in a radio program, Joe Chan Yung chau, Secretary in General of the Elderly Services Association of Hong Kong, said the industry has been seeing a continuous brain drain of therapists, nurses, and carers even though the sector is relaxing the threshold for hiring local staff. 'Both private and subsidized caring homes are facing the same problems,' Chan said. He mentioned the Social Welfare Department had earlier recruited care workers with a monthly salary of HK$30,000 during the fifth wave, while most applicants were unemployed and did not have a plan to pursue a long term career in caring work. Chan added that the labor loss may be due to the low salary and long working hours for caring work, describing the work as an 'offensive trade.' 'The government launched a scheme to introduce around 3,000 supplementary workers into caring centers during the fifth wave of the epidemic,' he said, 'but it didn't fill the gap created by the huge number of staff leaving.' Lawmaker Dennis Leung Tsz wing claimed many carers would prefer to seek opportunities in public sectors like the Hospital Authorities for more stable pay and working hours. 'The 12 hour working day in residential care homes for the elderly, coupled with the low promotion expectation, contributed to the shorthanded phenomenon,' he said.

It is learned that the scheme will be implemented in two phases, with restaurants banned from providing plastic chopsticks, forks, knives, straws, and cups   to diners and for takeaway meals. The first phase is set to kick off next year with a fine of HK$2,000 to be imposed for an offense breaching the scheme, and the second phase to be completed in 2025, which will see plastic cutlery entirely prohibited across the city. According to the government, exemptions can be granted for packaged foodstuffs, like straws attached to carton beverages. Plastic products for medical use will also be allowed. Besides, the government plans to double the charge for plastic bags from HK$0.5 to HK$1 at the end of this year. 'The new levy will reduce the disposal of plastic bags at the city's landfills by about 25 percent after its implementation,' said Tse Chin wan, Secretary for Environment and Ecology. He added relevant resolutions will be proposed in the Legislative Council on Wednesday   along with the maiden Policy Address of the Chief Executive, claiming the legislation will be issued on December 31 this year if approved.

Kwok Cheuk kin, known as the king of judicial reviews because of his frequent legal challenges, previously filed an application for a judicial review against Health Secretary Lo Chung mau's decision to invalidate the certificates, with High Court judge Russell Coleman later granted an interim relief order blocking the government move. Following the court decision, the Legal Aid Department turned down Kwok's application for public funds in the case on the grounds that he is not directly affected because he has received three doses of the Covid vaccine. Speaking to reporters today, Kwok quoted the judge who presides over his appeal as saying that the department should approve legal aid for his case as it involves public interest, with every single Hongkonger a stakeholder in the case. Kwok also confirmed that a woman who holds an exemption certificate   who he previously said would join in   will not be involved in his legal fight. The jab exemption certificates allow people who are not fully vaccinated to enter premises such as restaurants. Government lawyers earlier argued that the invalidation is justified on public health grounds and say that people affected can visit another doctor, including free public doctors, to seek a new exemption certificate.

The SAR's flagship carrier will also schedule another 400 plus flights to Asia and longhaul destinations while resuming five routes this month to Madrid, Dubai, Kathmandu, Milan and Bengaluru in India. The takeoff news came as Hong Kong yesterday reported just over 400 imported Covid 19 cases – the most in a single day since the SAR's first case was reported on January 22, 2020. Still, Cathay said it had seen travel business improve last month, which was supported by student traffic from Hong Kong and the mainland. 'Overall passenger numbers further increased month on month to over 8,800 per day, while [patronage] was 72.5 percent,' said Cathay's chief customer and commercial officer, Ronald Lam Siu por. 'Passenger flight capacity stood at about 16 percent of pre pandemic levels.' Although demand for student travel to the United States eased down from the second week of last month, it was balanced by a surge from UK bound students, he said. And the airline increased Hong Kong UK flights from 111 in August to 134 last month, with 96 percent patronage. 'Inbound traffic to Hong Kong also improved, largely driven by demand from the United States and Canada,' Lam said. 'In the last week of September we saw a considerable increase in demand for flights to Singapore, Bangkok and Seoul.' Next month will also see close to 700 flights being added and then 1,200 in December. They will account for more than 500,000 seats. Among them, 140,000 seats will be allotted for Osaka, Tokyo's Narita and Haneda airports plus Sapporo. They come with 146 additional Japanese flights next month and 234 in December, covering the Christmas peak season. London's Heathrow Airport will see 31,500 seats on additional flights over the coming two months, with four daily flights on certain days in December. First class cabins will also return on prime London Heathrow flights from December 5. The cost of Cathay tickets to Japan, one of the most popular destinations for Hongkongers, had dropped to HK$6,833 for a one way ticket to Narita airport even for the Christmas and New Year holiday period, according to the airline's booking site last night. For a week long round trip departing and returning on weekdays the cheapest tickets are HK$5,798. Meanwhile, Korean Air will increase flights between Hong Kong and Incheon from seven to 11 per week in December. Asiana Airlines is also gearing to increase weekly flights to South Korea from five to seven in that month. Yesterday was also the 1,000th day from when Covid first struck Hong Kong. Since the start it has claimed 10,278 lives in the SAR, while there have been more than 1.84 million citizens infected. The Centre for Health Protection yesterday reported 5,361 infections – 4,954 locally transmitted and 407 imported – as the daily caseload surpassed 5,000 for a fifth straight day. Five more deaths of four men and a woman aged from 63 to 96 linked to Covid were also reported yesterday, with two of the cases from care homes. But government Covid adviser Ivan Hung Fan ngai was looking on a brighter side, saying Hong Kong was hopeful for 'full resumption to normalcy' by next summer. Hung also said a vast majority of citizens have been vaccinated or have recovered from Covid infections, so the SAR has established 'herd immunity.' While he cautioned on radio that with the emergence of new and more contagious subvariants the infection numbers will increase the ratio of severe cases will remain low. Also on radio, infectious disease expert Ho Pak leung suggested authorities should shorten quarantine for infected people to five days from seven and also cancel self isolation rules for close contacts.

At the same time, he said many social and economic activities have gradually resumed since the SAR implemented the '0+3' quarantine scheme, with many international events being held in the city. Lee said the measure had yielded positive results, however, he said he understood citizens' desire for the '0+0' rule, where authorities would roll out new measures according to the development of the city's Covid situation. Speaking ahead of his weekly Executive Council meeting, the Hong Kong leader said that since the '0+3' rule kicked in, airport traffic had increased, with passenger volume increasing by 1.5 times from last month. He believed the number would keep surging with airliners hiring more staffers, calling on Hongkongers to have faith in the city. Meanwhile, Lee also noted an increase in imported cases that comes with the '0+3' rule, with the proportion of the cases now taking up to 5 percent of the total case tally from the previous 2.7 percent. The average number of severe diseases and death from Covid last week also went up by 28 percent and 20 percent, respectively, when compared to the previous week, he said. Lee stressed that Hong Kong must play it safe with the easing of its anti epidemic measures, especially when the emergence of a new mutant Covid strain could be possible.

British police are investigating after a man was dragged into the consulate's grounds and beaten by several men during a demonstration against Chinese President Xi Jinping on Sunday. The man, whose first name is Bob, is in his 30s and emigrated to the UK from Hong Kong recently, according to a friend close to him. He did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The protest, involving 30 40 people including Hongkongers now resident in Britain, took place at the start of a twice a decade congress of China's ruling Communist Party in Beijing at which Xi is widely expected to win a third leadership term. I trust that the local government will deal with the case in accordance with the Vienna convention on consular relations, and the local law, Lee told a weekly news conference. I will make no more comment because I don't have full details of the case. Police in Manchester said due to our fears for the safety of the man, officers intervened and removed the victim from the consulate grounds. The victim spent the night in hospital for treatment and an investigation is ongoing, police added in a statement. Alicia Kearns, a lawmaker in the ruling Conservative Party and the new head of parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Twitter that China's Manchester consul general, Zheng Xiyuan, had full sight, and was quite possibly involved, in the assaults. The Chinese consulate in Manchester did not respond to requests from Reuters for comment via email and the consulate's official Wechat account, including regarding allegations that consulate staff had been involved. A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Liz Truss said the reports were deeply concerning. The incident was triggered when several men came out of the consulate and tried taking down several protest banners, including one with the slogan: Heaven will destroy the Chinese Communist Party, and a caricature of Xi wearing a crown. Security has been tight in Beijing as the party congress gets underway, and police last week removed rare banners of political protest   including one calling for Xi's ouster   from an overpass.

Sim, 52, was born and raised in Vancouver and was the founder of the Canadian home healthcare company Nurse Next Door. He won 85,732 votes, well ahead of Stewart's 49,593. The path to get here was incredibly long   135 years after the first Chinese head tax was paid just for the right to come here and work on building a railway, Sim said in his victory speech. The history of this moment isn't lost on me, but the honor really goes to those whose shoulders I stand on. Sim thanked his late parents, who had a comfortable life in Hong Kong but chose to move to Vancouver in 1967 so that their children could have a better life. My parents sacrificed a lot so their kids could have a place to live, an education and a better life, Sim said. When they came here, they struggled. They struggled through racism, they struggled financially, and later on in life, they struggled with some serious health issues ... But they never gave up. Sim's father was the uncle of Bernard Chan. Chan said that his uncle had five children and three of them were born in Hong Kong. Sim is the youngest son. Asked whether Chan will use his relationship with Sim to boost ties between Vancouver and Hong Kong, he said there are a lot of Hong Kong migrants in Vancouver so the relationship between the two cities is close but cultural exchanges can be further enhanced. Sim plans to make Vancouver safe again and has vowed to launch an anti racism task force. wallis.wang@singtaonewscorp.com Today's Standard Trademark and Copyright Notice: Copyright 2022, The Standard Newspaper Publishing Ltd., and its related entities.

But the move has led to controversy. In its fourth design since CUHK was established in 1963, the new emblem's background is no longer gold and purple, with a dual tone gold and purple phoenix on top. The new emblem has a gold phoenix on a purple shield, with the school motto Through learning and temperance to virtue on a ribbon below. The university said the pure purple background can make the mythical Chinese phoenix clearer, more distinctive and dynamic. The phoenix is a bird that is able to rise from the ashes of its predecessor, symbolizing rebirth. In Chinese culture, the bird represents duty, propriety, credibility and mercy. Over the past six decades, CUHK has come a long way and is recognized today as a leading comprehensive research university in Asia and the world, said vice chancellor and president Professor Rocky Tuan Sung chi. As we prepare for the advent of our new 'Jiazi' (a 60 year cycle), we have thought carefully with our stakeholders about the journey we have traveled and how we can build on our strong heritage to future proof the CUHK brand over the decades to come. The university said it has spent nearly a year listening to the views of more than 200 staff, students, alumni, council members, the public, as well as local, mainland and international partners, for the redesign. But lawmaker and CUHK council member Edward Lau Kwok fan said it was disrespectful that the university did not conduct any consultations, saying: Nobody knows anything about this. I am planning to hold a meeting with the school council. Changing the emblem would hit a nerve for many people, he added. Students and netizens said that the new phoenix looks like a pheasant and that the removal of the ribbon with the school motto was an attempt to de Anglicize the emblem. Lawmaker Tommy Cheung Yu yan, another university council member, said he received an invitation to a presentation on the new emblem yesterday. The move was strange, he said. A newspaper wouldn't change its logo, then tell its board members, would it? he asked, adding that the incident was an indication that the university management was acting as if the council members are dead. Bill Tang Ka piu, a CUHK council member, said he found out about the new emblem only yesterday.

The move reduced democratic representation in the legislature, tightened control of elections and introduced a pro Beijing vetting panel to select candidates. The Hong Kong government said the overhaul would ensure the city's stability and prosperity. But the changes also prompted international condemnation, as it makes it near impossible for pro democracy candidates to stand. The official White Paper on 'Hong Kong Democratic Progress Under the Framework of One Country, Two Systems,' released on December 20, 2021, affirmed that during the British colonial administration, there was no democracy in Hong Kong. The Central Political Committee devised the 'One Country, Two Systems' policy in early 1980s, and it is the backbone Let's hope most Hongkongers have some personal triumphs to celebrate when the clock strikes midnight to ring in 2022. Because, let's face it, the city as a whole does not have much to crow about over the past year.  It's been, to borrow a phrase once famously employed by Hong Kong's former monarch, an annus horribilis.

https://hongkongfp.com/hong-kong-free-press-annual-report-2021/;; Hong Kong Free Press Annual Report 2021; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit Our latest Annual Report includes a Transparency Report based on our latest yearly, independent audit. Letter from the Editor Dear readers and supporters, Over the past year, the HKFP newsroom underwent a transformation – we expanded, professionalised, moving to a new, larger, private office. We doubled our freelance budget, hired three new staff, won a SOPA award, and produced almost 150 fully fledged original features. Our team covered the first 'patriots only' election, Covid 19, the national security law, and we exceeded our Funding Drive target, bringing 1,000 monthly Patrons online. But 2021 was also a brutal year for the media industry in Hong Kong, with newsrooms raided, editors arrested and outlets disbanding in fear. In all, over 60 civil society groups disappeared last year, all whilst the authorities said press freedom was intact, deeming foreign criticism of journalist arrests a violation of international law. Yet we are continuing our work. HKFP was founded seven years ago as a response to press freedom concerns, but – aside from our 2020 work visa denial – our newsroom has never been directly troubled by the authorities. This is likely owing to our impartial stance, transparent funding, and balanced coverage guided by an Ethics Code and Corrections Policy. Press freedom is guaranteed by the Basic Law, Bill of Rights and security law – it is in our name, and it is on this basis that we operate. For these reasons, HKFP staff are united in our commitment to continue our on the ground award winning reporting. Nonetheless, we cannot be naïve when it comes to ensuring staff safety and security, protecting sources, and trying our best to navigate unclear legal realities whilst test cases go through court. We are a Hong Kong news outlet, we love this city, and we have not entertained the idea of reporting on it from elsewhere. Besides, it is only by being on the ground that we can maintain nuance and accuracy through attending events, press conferences, court cases and speaking directly with Hongkongers. But because of the current uncertainties facing journalists, we may make some precautionary changes this year upon legal advice. Above all though, we will always be guided by the journalistic tradition, our ethics code, and the day to day mission of ensuring accuracy and fairness. And despite recent events, we do not believe there are any Hong Kong stories we would have to avoid reporting. I am happy to present our Annual Report, as we round up our best coverage, achievements, and our accounts from the past 12 months. During this coming year, we look forward to covering the city's leadership race, the 25 th anniversary of the Handover, the pandemic and court cases. And with your support and readership, the HKFP team will continue to hold the line and press on! Our Mission & Impact Founded in 2015, Hong Kong Free Press is an impartial, non profit, award winning English language newspaper. Run by journalists, backed by readers and completely independent, HKFP is governed by a public code of ethics. Best of 2021 Original features: Our features in 2021 documented Hong Kong's transformation under the shadow of the Beijing enacted security law. We delved into how counsellors and psychologists grappled with the fear of creeping self censorship in their practice, how booksellers were reported to the national security police during the Hong Kong Book Fair for selling politically sensitive titles, and how one of the city's last remaining independent bookstores shuttered, citing the political environment. We also looked at how the city's filmmakers, publishers and street artists navigated the shifting red lines, and how some Hongkongers are inking messages of resistance onto their own skin. The city's media landscape forever changed last year with the closure of pro democracy newspaper Apple Daily. HKFP was at its newsrooms and printing presses on its last day of operations. We also explored how the city's Beijing backed press are gaining more influence. The year also saw the mass resignations of pro democracy district councillors after new oath requirements were introduced. We documented the final days of one local councillor in office and explored how the exodus of district representatives also left community newspapers struggling. As protest related and national security cases piled up in the city's courts, we spoke with lawyers compiling a protest case database to preserve the city's rule of law, the activists writing letters to detained protesters, and the international lawyers who launched an advice website to inform Hongkongers of their legal rights. We also spoke with a refugee from Vietnam who was stuck behind bars for almost three decades after being convicted of murder as a teenager, and eventually decided to abandon his fight against deportation. Amid the changes of 2021, a wave of Hongkongers left for the UK. HKFP was at the airport when long queues formed as people bid farewell to loved ones. In the UK, we reported on the people helping newly arrived Hongkongers settle in, as well the pro China groups pressuring them. Hong Kong also saw the implementation of a sweeping overhaul of the city's electoral system. HKFP gave extensive coverage on the day of the city's first 'patriots only' legislative election – candidates made urgent appeal to voters while Hong Kong saw the lowest turnout rate ever. Following a 48 hour purge of Tiananmen Massacre monuments from university campuses over Christmas, we also spoke with students, academics, as well as artists behind the statues about what the removals meant for Hong Kong's efforts to commemorate those who died in the military crackdown of student led demonstrations over 32 years ago. Our team visited local businesses at risk of forced closure after government led redevelopments in Fo Tan and Kwun Tong. Elsewhere, we spoke with the owners of Hong Kong's remaining iconic Dai Pai Dongs facing eviction from their community, and the elderly villager fighting to save his home from developers in the New Territories. We also reported on the opening of the newly revamped historic Central Market and the long awaited M+ museum. Covid 19 restrictions continued to disrupt Hongkongers' daily lives last year. We examined government statistics to question whether the city's severe quarantine measures were really necessary, how even vaccinated people were forced into quarantine centres, how foreign domestic workers faced more challenging working conditions during the pandemic, and the rise in discrimination against South East Asians. We also delved into the trend of 'vaccine selfies,' how pandemic related pressure on airlines led some pilots to accuse companies of age discrimination, and the plight of those left stranded in the UK during Hong Kong's months long flight suspensions. Our pandemic coverage also tackled how the coronavirus made life even more difficult in the city's sub divided flats, the refugees excluded from the city's vaccination programme, how local mask manufacturers survived in an inundated market, and how local businesses responded to the government mandated tracing app. Beyond politics, we delved into the world of polyamory to explore how some Hongkongers navigate romantic ties beyond traditional partnerships, explored the little known history of siu mai, met the bus fanatics turning Hong Kong bus seats into office chairs, and published a probe into one of the city's oldest sporting associations. We also looked at how a Muslim headscarf sparked a discrimination row at a school and how volunteers helped to restore Hong Kong's Hindu cemetery. 2021 was also a big year for Hong Kong sports. We spoke to local athletes during the Tokyo games to learn about daily life at the Olympic village, as well as to the city's Paralympians about their dreams of sporting glory. We continued to cover environmental and animal stories last year, including the threat to rare porpoises posed by a development off Lantau, and the task force fighting against dog poisonings. Last year, we produced 144 fully fledged features, over 35 interviews, 256 opinion pieces and 276 stories on the 'patriots only' elections. We have also published over 1,000 stories on the national security law, and over 1,000 on Covid 19. HKFP Venture also relaunched with over a dozen guides to outdoor adventures. We expanded our coverage from across the Taiwan Strait, profiling the people fighting for dual citizenship, Hong Kong artists in self exile, the Hongkongers seeking to contribute to Taiwanese society, the launch of an ambitious new English language news platform, and the Hongkongers who have joined the local movement to revive the use of Taiwanese in daily life. We also spoke with the Taiwanese maths teacher posting educational videos on Pornhub, cautiously asking: why? Over the border in mainland China, we reported on a Hongkonger with a history of mental illness who was executed for drug trafficking despite pleas from family and rights groups. And further afield, we reported on the Hongkongers fighting for democracy in Myanmar after the military coup. Explanatory Reporting: HKFP continued its monthly explainer series on how the city has changed under the Beijing enacted security law, and we continued our 'shifting narratives' series on how the city's leaders' attitude towards the Tiananmen Massacre and the traditional mass pro democracy marches on July 1 evolved over recent years. We wrote explainers on major political developments, including how Beijing overhauled the city's electoral system, how authorities moved to erase the memory of Tiananmen, and how the largest teachers' union was forced to dissolve. We also explained how Hongkongers still found ways to resist despite the national security clampdown. HKFP also examined trends in leader Carrie Lam's past policy addresses after she delivered the last one of her current term, analysing what it all meant for the city's future. We broke down how Beijing's overhaul of the city's electoral process ensured that almost every candidate for the new Election Committee was guaranteed a seat. We looked at where Beijing's national security crackdown has left the city's pro democracy camp, and who the approved candidates were in the city's first legislative poll following the sweeping overhaul. Our team also wrote practical guides informing our readers how to sign up for the government's electronic stimulus vouchers, how to enter lucky draws for the fully vaccinated, how to get vaccinated against Covid 19, and how to write letters to prisoners. Interviews: Last year, we touched in again with Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei about what he saw as the future of art in the city. We also spoke with Democratic Party leader Lo Kin hei about the party's future in the shifting political climate, and political scientist Ma Ngok on what Beijing's electoral overhaul means for democracy in Hong Kong. At the other end of the political spectrum, we spoke to the founder of the new pro Beijing Bauhinia Party Charles Wong, and pro establishment lawmaker Michael Tien on the future of Hong Kong politics. We also sat down with pro Beijing figure Adrian Ho about running one of the city's largest pro establishment online communities. We spoke with a number of activists before they were put behind bars, including democrat and labour activist Raphael Wong ahead of his sentencing for an unauthorised assembly, and student activist Wong Yat chin before he was arrested and denied bail under the security law. We also spoke to other dissidents, including former student leader Owen Au about what he saw as the future of protest in the city and investigative journalist Bao Choy after her conviction over accessing public records for a documentary on alleged police collusion with triads. We interviewed dissidents elsewhere in the region, including Singaporean activist Jolovan Wham about his arrest after a one man protest. And during the Tokyo Olympics, we were the first newspaper to catch up with Hong Kong's only gold medal winner, fencer Edgar Cheung, about how he kept calm under pressure. Arts: We also sat down with the city's creatives, including the director of the protest documentary 'Revolution of our Times' Kiwi Chow about why he is staying put in the city, musician Cehryl on the impact of Covid on live music, artist Sampson Wong on finding beauty in Hong Kong, and Yim Chiu tong, the Plumber King, whose advertisements became part of a street art exhibition. In Taiwan, our reporter interviewed the island's only weed lawyer, a politician defending democracy on Matsu island 17 km from mainland China, and dissident Wu'er Kaixi ahead of the 32nd anniversary of the Tiananmen Massacre. And we also spoke with Taipei based singer Kimberley Chen about shrugging off China's censors. Authors: We spoke with journalist and author Joanna Chiu about her new book detailing China's web of influence abroad and Western complicity in China's rise, and veteran journalist Stephen Vines about his last book on Hong Kong before he fled back to the UK. 'Patriots poll: Ahead of the city's first 'patriots only' legislative race, we spoke to three candidates from across the political spectrum including self proclaimed non pro establishment Adrian Lau, Vincent Diu, an electrician who declared as independent, and Nixie Lam, who was seen by her pro establishment supporters as their international spokesperson. After the race, we also sat down with Tik Chi yuen, the only lawmaker elect who claimed to be non pro establishment. Scoops: We broke the story of how mainland Chinese and Hong Kong Wikipedia users were fighting over the narrative of the Hong Kong protests on the site, and the ensuing safety concerns for Hong Kong users. As a result of our report on the Wikipedia wars, the site banned seven mainland Chinese users for 'infiltration and exploitation.' We found Hong Kong public libraries had removed almost a fifth of titles relating to the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre from their shelves since 2009, and that the Bar Association had launched probes into legal icons Martin Lee and Margaret Ng after their convictions for unauthorised assembly. We also broke the story of how city authorities spent millions of taxpayer dollars to lobby Washington against the passing of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. 2020 Achievements NewsStream project complete: In 2019, HKFP won a US$78,400 (HK$615,440) Google News Initiative grant to create an open source funding platform for small newsrooms focussed on nurturing reader membership. The funds went to third party developers to help create NewsStream – a fundraising micro site to reduce barriers and costs for independent news start ups. Our new support.hongkongfp.com site finally launched in 2021, allowing readers to begin, pause and cancel memberships.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/10/18/second-hong-kong-doctor-charged-over-alleged-false-covid-19-vaccination-exemptions/;2022-10-18 18:04:00+08:00; Second Hong Kong doctor charged over alleged false Covid 19 vaccination exemptions; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit A second doctor has been charged over allegedly issuing Covid 19 vaccination exemption certificates without following official guidelines, less than a month after charges were laid against another medic accused of the same misconduct. Annie Choi, 64, appeared at the Tuen Mun Magistrates' Court on Tuesday. She faces two counts of conspiracy to defraud. According to a police charge sheet, Choi allegedly conspired with two patients, Mo Hung san and Chiu Lin mui, 'to defraud the HKSAR government by dishonestly representing that an assessment was conducted' before she issued jab exemptions to Mo and Chiu on September 3. Choi was granted bail for $100,000 and will return to court on December 13. She was among six medical practitioners arrested on suspicion of handing out vaccination exemptions without conducting prior diagnoses last month. A seventh doctor, whose clinic was the target of a police sting operation in March, is believed to have 'virtually' signed off on hundreds of vaccination exemption certificates. He is thought to have fled Hong Kong. The seven doctors stand accused of signing off more than 20,000 exemptions without conducting proper diagnosis, with each costing between HK$350 and HK$5,000. Also on Tuesday, Kwok Cheuk kin, the 'king of judicial reviews,' won an appeal against the Legal Aid Department's decision to reject his legal aid application. Kwok launched a legal challenge against the government's plan to annul the vaccination exemptions issued by the seven doctors in question, causing their invalidation to be temporarily blocked. The department earlier said Kwok's application was rejected because he was not a vaccine exemption certificate holder and thus the issue did not apply to him. Kwok has received three doses of a Covid 19 vaccine. '[The judge] knew that this was a matter of public interest  When I launched a judicial review over the small house policy, I was not a stakeholder either, but the Legal Aid Department approved my aid application because that was about public interest,' Kwok told reporters outside the High Court after a closed door hearing that lasted for around an hour. At a hearing last week, Kwok argued that the government had no legal power to invalidate the exemptions, adding that none of the doctors had been tried, let alone convicted, so the authorities' move would be 'passing a judgement before a hearing.' Justice Russell Coleman in the end decided to temporarily bar the government from invalidating the medical exemptions concerned, with the next hearing to be held on Thursday. Judicial reviews are considered by the Court of First Instance and examine the decision making processes of administrative bodies. Issues under review must be shown to affect the wider public interest. At his weekly press briefing on Tuesday, Chief Executive John Lee sidestepped a reporter's question on whether the government would invoke the power under the Emergency Regulation Ordinance to annul the vaccination exemptions should it lose the judicial review. 'As everybody knows this matter has entered legal procedures, I will not comment,' Lee said. 'On anti epidemic policies, the government is trying its very best to control the pandemic, and controlling the pandemic is for the interest of every one  The government of course will act according to the law and will follow up only after the court makes a ruling.'

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/10/18/almost-half-of-hongkongers-have-low-or-no-expectations-for-john-lees-first-policy-address-survey-finds/;2022-10-18 16:47:00+08:00; Almost half of Hongkongers have low or no expectations for John Lee's first Policy Address, survey finds; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit Almost half of Hongkongers surveyed in a recent poll expressed that they had low or no expectations for Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee's first Policy Address, which will be delivered on Wednesday. The Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute (PORI) surveyed 4,736 residents over the age of 12 online between October 7 and 12, and released the results in a press meeting last Friday. Thirty two per cent of respondents said they had 'no expectation' for the upcoming Policy Address, while 17 per cent said they had low expectations. Meanwhile, 28 per cent told the researchers they had high expectations and 19 per cent answered 'half half.' Nevertheless, the findings suggested Lee was seen in a more positive light than his predecessor. A similar study conducted by PORI ahead of then chief executive Carrie Lam's final set of policy proposals found that only 15 per cent of respondents had high expectations, while a total of 57 per cent had either low or no expectations. The results of this year's poll also showed that more than 80 per cent of respondents thought it was necessary for Lee's first Policy Address to deal with 'healthcare and public health' as well as 'housing' issues. Respondents, however, gave split answers when it came to assessing Lee's first 100 days in office as Hong Kong's leader. Thirty per cent said they were satisfied with his policy direction, 31 per cent were dissatisfied, and another 30 per cent answered 'half half.' Political commentator Derek Yuen said during the press conference to release the survey results that Lee's administration was still in its 'honeymoon period,' as the chief executive wasnew to the office. However, Yuen said he was concerned that people who supported the government or held a centrist stance might lose their confidence in the new administration 'if there continues to be a lack of political achievements  or people can't see significant improvements in Hong Kong's situation.' Yuen was also worried that the government's emphasis on housing policies might backfire and lead to a downfall in its popularity, as he said housing and land problems 'usually cannot be solved within the current term [of administration].' During the same conference, Kenneth Chan, an associate professor in political science at the Hong Kong Baptist University and former chairperson of the pro democracy Civic Party, said the new administration had not 'seriously' conducted public consultation. Chan said the government had only hosted two face to face sessions at the district level and most of the attendees were invited members from government appointed organisations or their 'satellite groups.' 'We haven't seen a government that is willing to hear, reach out to people or visit residents in different districts,' Chan said, adding that District Councils' ability to collect local opinions had been 'almost paralysed' after the mass resignation of pro democracy District Councillors. The pro democracy camp won a landslide victory in the 2019 District Council elections, when Hong Kong was in the midst of months long protests and unrest. But since the introduction of mandatory oaths of allegiance in May last year, over 200 District Council seats have been left vacant.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/10/18/1000-days-of-covid-19-in-hong-kong-in-data/;2022-10-18 16:35:00+08:00; 1,000 days of Covid 19 in Hong Kong – in data; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit Hong Kong recorded its first suspected Covid 19 case – involving a traveller from Wuhan, China – on January 22, 2020. Tuesday marks 1,000 days since the date, when health officials first set up a dedicated website to publish Covid related information and began issuing daily press releases on the number of new infections each day. The case was confirmed the following day. With Covid 19 banished to the history books across much of the world, Hong Kong retains some of the same harsh restrictions that have been enforced since the early days of the pandemic. Although the controversial hotel quarantine requirement for travellers has been axed, arrivals must still complete several Covid 19 tests in the days after landing. Masks remain mandatory, including in outdoor spaces, as do group gathering limits in public. HKFP looks back on 1,000 days of the local pandemic in data Hong Kong has reported over 1.8 million Covid 19 cases since the pandemic began, including both local and imported cases. A total of 10,273 Covid 19 patients have died, with 10,060 of those deaths recorded since the fifth wave – defined by the government as December 31, 2021, onwards – began. The vast majority of the deaths have been among the elderly and the immunocompromised. Hong Kong's rule mandating mask wearing outdoors came into effect on July 29, 2020. Before that, facial coverings were only compulsory indoors. The government exempted people from wearing masks in country parks, or while conducting physical activity, in May. Hong Kong has enforced bans on dining in at restaurants after 6 p.m. three times. The first ban began in July 2020 and lasted around six weeks, and was lifted in August. The second ban, put in place in December 2020, was relaxed in February 2021. The longest ban lasted over 100 days from January to April this year. The city recorded 76,991 Covid 19 cases on March 3, the highest ever in a single day. Hong Kong's coronavirus outbreak peaked in early March and gradually declined in the weeks after, seeing daily cases fall to four digit figures towards the end of the month. Over 2,580 animals were culled by the government in January after authorities said hamster to human transmission of Covid 19 was detected, according to a government press release. They included 2,298 hamsters. The government disbursed HK$5,000 in 2021, and HK$10,000 this year, to Hong Kong residents in a bid to boost the Covid ridden economy. Those who have left, or believed to intend to leave the city, were barred from collecting the second round of the HK$5,000 hand out in this year's scheme as the territory suffered a period of brain drain. Hong Kong has recorded drastic dips in visitor arrivals since Covid 19 began due to the city's strict travel related restrictions. The month that saw the fewest number of arrivals was in March this year, when just 1,800 visitors entered Hong Kong. In contrast, 5,860,346 visitors arrived in the city in March 2019. Hong Kong's public beaches, managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, were shut for 272 days. The first two closures – from July to November 2020, and December 2020 to April 2021 – lasted over 100 days each. The most recent closure, during the city's fifth Covid 19 wave, was in place for 49 days from March to May. Almost 5.6 million people in Hong Kong have received three doses of the Covid 19 vaccine, according to the government's vaccine dashboard on Sunday. Based on the city's population of people aged 12 and over, the figure accounts for 80.4 per cent of Hong Kong.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/10/18/4-hong-kong-men-held-in-custody-while-awaiting-sentencing-over-attack-on-lawyer-at-security-law-protest/;2022-10-18 15:56:00+08:00; 4 Hong Kong men held in custody while awaiting sentencing over attack on lawyer at security law protest; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit A Hong Kong court has remanded four men into custody pending sentencing next month, after the group was convicted over wounding a lawyer at an illegal protest against the national security law in May 2020. Deputy District Judge Daniel Tang on Tuesday heard mitigation pleas from defendants Tong Kin pong, Yue Wai lun, Cheng Hok ming and Owen Wong, who were found guilty of wounding solicitor Chan Tze chin with intent on May 24, 2020. That day, several thousands of Hongkongers gathered in Causeway Bay to rally against Beijing's announcement that it would enact the security legislation in the city. According to the prosecution's case, protesters lit multiple fires around the commercial district and vandalised the clothing store I.T. Shop and the entrance of China Taiping Tower. Chan was attacked after he condemned the demonstrators' acts and said they would be arrested by the police. As Chan was leaving the scene, some protesters hit him from behind with umbrellas and other hard objects, and warned that they would 'beat him to death' if he called the police. The lawyer tried to run away but was pursued by some protesters. Chan's T shirt was torn, while he suffered 'severe attacks' on his head and neck, prosecutors said. Someone also threw a large metal road sign at Chan, which landed behind the lawyer. He eventually ran to the South China Athletic Association, where staff members called the police. Chan was hospitalised and his chin, right neck, left palm and left leg required stitches. The four defendants were originally prosecuted for rioting and wounding, but Yue, Cheng and Wong reached a plea deal before the case was set to move to trial earlier this month. They pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful assembly and one count of wounding with intent, while Yue's possession of offensive weapon charge was kept on court file. Truck driver Tong, on the other hand, denied his charges and was put on trial. But the 33 year old changed his plea to guilty last week, after the court ruled that the prosecution presented sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case against him. Under police caution, Tong admitted that he had attended the protest alone. He said he kicked and punched Chan three times because he was 'angry' at the solicitor's criticism, adding that he had acted 'impulsively.' During mitigation on Tuesday, the defence said Chan did not sustain any permanent injury from the attack. Cheng's lawyer said his 25 year old client engaged in the attack for less than two seconds and was remorseful, while the counsel representing 17 year old Wong said the defendant was very young and did not play a leading role in the attack. Judge Tang adjourned the case to November 4 for sentencing, pending background reports and psychological reports for Tong, Yue and Cheng. The court also ordered a series of reports to evaluate whether Wong, a minor, was suitable for sentencing to other types of correctional facilities. The demonstration took place a little over a month before the Beijing imposed legislation came into force on June 30, 2020. At least 180 people were arrested on the day, mostly on suspicion of allegedly participating in an illegal assembly. Enacted in the aftermath of the 2019 extradition bill unrest, the national security law criminalised subversion, secession, collusion with foreign forces and terrorist acts, which were broadly defined to include disruption to transport and other infrastructure. The move gave police sweeping new powers, alarming democrats, civil society groups and trade partners, as such laws have been used broadly to silence and punish dissidents in China. However, the authorities say it has restored stability and peace to the city.

'The 20th National Congress report had many highlights. I was most encouraged by the report's many mentions of One Country, Two Systems, and parts relating to Hong Kong,' Lee said during a weekly press briefing on Tuesday. 'The report also mentioned that Hong Kong and Macau need to leverage their advantages and characteristics, including boosting their standing,' Lee added, emphasising areas such as international finance, aviation and tourism. Xi's almost two hour long address on Sunday, which kicked off China's twice a decade Communist Party Congress, hailed Hong Kong's restoration of order since the political unrest in 2019. Lee on Tuesday rehashed many of the points made in Xi's speech, including the need for Hong Kong to address deep rooted problems and 'fully implement' the One Country, Two Systems framework. 'The content [in Xi's speech] relating to Hong Kong and Macau was plentiful, and serves as an operational guide for future work,' he added. Lee's press briefing came a day before his Policy Address on Wednesday. The annual speech, which previews the policy agenda for the coming years, will be Lee's first since being elected to the city's top leadership post in an uncontested race in May. He brought a copy of the address to the briefing, which he said contained policies aimed at boosting Hong Kong's competitiveness and tackling livelihood issues. Xi made similar mentions on Sunday, as well as in a speech delivered on July 1, when he visited the city to mark the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China. The cover of the Policy Address booklet was green, a colour Lee described as representing 'hope, vitality, harmony and stability.' Lee did not reveal the contents of the address on Tuesday. Local media, however, has reported that measures designed to attract talent to Hong Kong were expected to be a focus. The leader will announce the establishment of an office that will work on enticing overseas talent to the city by offering incentives in areas such as education for their children, according to media outlets including Ming Pao and Now News. Lawmakers from pro Beijing party the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) said last month that Hong Kong needed to 'think out of the box' when it came to encouraging skilled professionals to settle down in the city, calling on Lee to put incentives in place. The DAB's proposal came amid a mass exodus – seen in record high school vacancies and pension fund withdrawals – which many have attributed to the political situation and the city's strict Covid 19 policies. Local media outlets also reported that Lee is expected to announce plans for a new MTR line that will connect Yuen Long, in the northern part of Hong Kong, with Kowloon Tong. This would ease the burden on the Tuen Ma Line, which stretches from the western end of the New Territories to the east.

A further two defendants, however, have maintained their pleas of not guilty over their alleged involvement in a 'global anti totalitarianism' rally near Admiralty on September 29, 2019. Fung Ka man, Au Yeung Chi kin, Ku Ka wa, Lee Tak hin, Cheung Hing man, Chan Shue fung, Yau Wai to, Lam Ho sang, Lam Yiu chun, Tse Tat chi and Chan Hoi fung appeared at the District Court on Monday. All of them faced one count of rioting. Fung and Chan Hoi fung maintained their initial not guilty pleas while the remaining nine , including an emergency room doctor and a surveyor, decided to plead guilty right before the official trial. A twelfth defendant in the case pleaded guilty in September, according to the Witness. The prosecution alleged that on that day, protesters organised an unauthorised 'anti totalitarianism' rally against China's rule over Hong Kong, which started in Causeway Bay and headed towards the government headquarters near Admiralty, local media reported. Hundreds of demonstrators blocked traffic along Harcourt Road, a major thoroughfare, in the afternoon, hurling petrol bombs and bricks at police and government infrastructure, the prosecution said. Police attempted to disperse the crowd with a water canon and tear gas. During Monday's hearing, the court heard of the defendants' arrests. The prosecution said all the defendants were wearing dark coloured clothing, while some were apprehended with protest gear, such as goggles, respirators and helmets. One was carrying a colonial era Hong Kong flag, and several were described as having resisted officers while being subdued. District Judge Cheang Kei hong convicted the nine who pleaded guilty. Eight of them were remanded until their mitigation hearing on November 25. Academy of Performing Arts student Lam Yiu chun was granted bail so that he could attend his graduation on Thursday. He was required to return to court the next day and have his bail revoked. The trial, meanwhile, will continue on Tuesday for the two defendants who pleaded not guilty. They were also granted bail. Almost 100 people were charged over the anti totalitarianism protest. They have been divided into several cases. Some of the trials have concluded, with defendants jailed up to five years for rioting, and younger ones sentenced to a training centre. Protests erupted in June 2019 over a since axed extradition bill. They escalated into sometimes violent displays of dissent against police behaviour, amid calls for democracy and anger over Beijing's encroachment. Demonstrators demanded an independent probe into the police conduct, amnesty for those arrested and a halt to the characterisation of protests as 'riots.'

Defendant Chui Chun man appeared before Acting Principal Magistrate Veronica Heung on Monday, when the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts was scheduled to begin a five day trial against the former uniformed officer. The magistrate had to handle disputes concerning the evidence before the trial hearing could officially get underway. Chui was said to have done an act or acts with seditious intention between September 25 and 28 last year by posting comments on the police Facebook page, which were intended to incite hatred or contempt against the government and the judiciary. The defence on Monday sought to bar prosecutors from presenting the content extracted from two of Chui's phones as evidence, saying the devices were unlocked with a passcode which the defendant had 'involuntarily' provided. According to the defence, Chui was ordered to hand over his phone by three senior officers on September 28, 2021, when he returned Ma On Shan Police Station after patrolling. The trio allegedly cited disciplinary violations in requesting to inspect Chui's phone. A senior sergeant was said to have asked Chui to provide his passcode, warning that he could face another disciplinary violation if he did not act accordingly. Chui was asked if he had other mobile devices and he gave the senior officers another phone, telling the trio that he used the same passcode for all of his phones. He was suspended the next day. Police later arrested and charged Chui last November. He has been on bail pending trial. The comments Chui allegedly made related to the death of marine officer Lam Yuen yee, who drowned during a police operation against suspected smuggling. The speedboat she was on collided with a vessel carrying suspected smugglers, causing it to capsize. Her body was found days later near the coast of Yi O on Lantau island. The prosecution on Monday summoned sergeant Wong Ming ho of the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau, who told the court that he found two comments on the police Facebook page left by an account under the name 'Chun Chui' on September 25, 2021. He later identified the defendant as the account user, after doing a license plate check based on a photo Chui posted with his vehicle. Without disclosing the content of Chui's comment, Wong described the comments as 'negative and suspicious,' saying it made him 'suspect whether he had other intentions.' The hearing will continue on Tuesday morning. Sedition is not covered by the Beijing imposed national security law, which targets secession, subversion, collusion with foreign forces and terrorist acts and mandates up to life imprisonment. Those convicted under the sedition law, which was last amended in the 1970s when Hong Kong was still a British colony, face a maximum penalty of two years in prison.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/10/17/hong-kong-foodpanda-delivery-workers-strike-over-cuts-to-their-earnings/;2022-10-17 17:45:00+08:00; Hong Kong Foodpanda delivery workers strike over cuts to their earnings; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit Workers for food delivery platform Foodpanda have gone on strike in Hong Kong over recent cuts to their income after the company introduced a new way of calculating earnings. The action, which saw riders refusing to accept orders, began on Saturday evening and continued through Sunday. Workers involved said they would not accept orders for Pandamart – the delivery platform's grocery service – from Monday to Friday, and would strike again next weekend if Foodpanda refused to negotiate. Workers who participated in the strike said their income had been reduced after the company introduced a new distance calculation method about two weeks ago. In a statement, Foodpanda said that the new mechanism 'directly addresses' earlier feedback from the delivery fleet and it was 'not launched with the intention to reduce overall service fees.' The new system – which uses Google Maps data to determine the actual distance covered by a rider instead of the linear delivery distance – was part of the company's promised changes after 300 delivery workers went on strike in November last year. On Saturday night, around 50 Foodpanda workers met the press outside Pandamart in Kowloon Bay. Speaking on behalf of the group, a delivery worker who gave his name as Boss told reporters that their income was now 'at least 30 per cent lower' than their average wage a year ago. According to Boss, delivery workers in 'most areas' participated in the strike. 'There would certainly not be less than 1,000 [participants],' he said. However, he said he could not provide reporters with the exact number for fear of 'retaliation' from the company. 'We understand that businesses in Hong Kong can operate freely. They should not be interfered with and should be making money. But stop exploiting us,' Boss said. Another delivery worker, Ahmad, added that the company said last November it would introduce the new distance calculation method within six months, but in the end it took almost 11 months. The system was launched on September 29. After the launch, Ahmad said the company 'immediately' lowered the distance component of their wage. 'We are forced to go very far  for [much] less money,' he said. Workers taking part in the strike raised a total of 10 demands. Apart from wage adjustments, Foodpanda was also asked to allow fleet members to freely reject or pass over orders, improve insurance, compensate workers for time spent waiting for orders to be prepared and offer bonuses for orders delivered in extreme weather. On Sunday evening, the group met with the press in Tuen Mun and announced they would continue their industrial action by boycotting all Pandamart orders across the city from Monday to Friday. The workers said they were planning on striking again over the coming weekends or until the company are willing to negotiate. In response to the workers' actions, FoodPanda said in statement on Saturday night that it had addressed all 15 demands raised during last year's strike. 'We understand couriers' concern about their income, but none of our initiatives were launched with the intention to reduce overall service fees,' the statement read. According to the delivery platform, Foodpanda has invested 17 per cent more into distance service fees since the new calculation method was introduced. It added that the delivery fleet on average received higher service fees for all vehicle types in all zones. The statement also said that Foodpanda's operations team had visited 20 zones in person to collect feedback from delivery workers but 'were disappointed to see only a few couriers join those sessions.' In addition, the company said face to face meetings with its fleet were held weekly at its Rider Hub in Tsim Sha Tsui. The company also told HKFP that the 'minimum base compensation component' for fleet members had remained unchanged since last November. However, after the introduction of the new system, the company 'noticed that there were some adjustments that still needed to be further optimised.'

British police have said a group of men came out of the consulate during a peaceful demonstration on Sunday afternoon and dragged one of the protesters inside the grounds and assaulted him. But Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin on Tuesday said the protesters were to blame and that 'violation of the peace and dignity of China's overseas embassies and consulates will not be tolerated'. 'The troublemakers illegally entered the Chinese Consulate General in Manchester, endangering the security of the premises,' Wang said at a daily press briefing. He urged the UK to 'earnestly fulfil its duties and take effective measures to step up protection of the premises and personnel of the Chinese embassy and consulates'. Shocking video spreading on HK Telegram channels showing someone from the PRC Consulate in Manchester kicking down pro democracy signs. A protestor then appears to have been dragged behind the Consulate gates and beaten by consulate staff. pic.twitter.com/tntvTz38DY A British government spokesman on Monday said reports of the incident were 'obviously deeply concerning,' adding that it would be 'inappropriate' to comment further while the police probe was ongoing. The protest took place as China opened its five yearly Communist Party Congress, where President Xi Jinping is widely expected to be handed a historic third term in power.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/10/16/land-of-milk-and-honey-project-to-preserve-hong-kongs-first-dairy-farm-keeps-sisters-memories-alive/;2022-10-16 23:02:00+08:00; Land of milk and honey: Project to preserve Hong Kong's first dairy farm keeps sisters' memories alive;" Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit For Pokfulam villager Tam Sau wa, the short walk from her home to The Pokfulam Farm just across the road is like travelling back through time to her childhood. Tam, better known as Wa Nui, grew up in the senior staff quarters of Hong Kong's first dairy farm, now classified as a Grade I historic building and the cornerstone of a recent conservation campaign. Tam's mother worked for the farm's last manager, and the family lived on the complex until the company halted operations in the 1980s, almost a century after it was established in 1886. Tucked behind two towering culinary schools, the farm's main building resembles a cosy cottage complete with a brilliant white façade, sky blue window frames and a tiled rooftop. Built in 1887, it complements the neo gothic style Béthanie Chapel just next door. On a hot and sunny September afternoon, Wa Nui was joined by her older sister Anka Tam – wearing a blue and white striped top that twinned with the building – to show HKFP around the revitalised farm. Restoration began in 2019 under a Development Bureau scheme and was completed earlier this year. 'There used to be a gate here – the main entrance – and as you walked inside, here was the 'rose road, ' which had roses planted on both sides of the path and was paved with stones. It was very beautiful,' said Wa Nui. Instead of ascending the stairs to the main building, where the farm manager and his family lived, Wa Nui and Anka turned to the former staff quarters where they spent most of their time, eager to tell their own story. Pushing open the first door to the single storey structure, which now serves as offices, the sisters quickly found the old kitchen where their mum would cook big meals and make food for festivities. Although the room now resembles a pantry with a round dining table and other kitchen equipment, the sisters' memories of its former iteration live on. 'Here was where we put the bucket of rice grain  The stone stove was here – we burnt firewood for cooking in the past, quite quaint,' Anka said as she gestured around the room. Wa Nui, meanwhile, remembered the long nights they spent there helping their mother at the stove. 'When we were young, we liked tailing our mum to make rice cakes during the Lunar New Year. They took a long time to make  so we would sit here on some hay. Because we needed to keep adding firewood, we would spend the whole night in the kitchen,' Wa Nui recalled. The sisters were equally eager to share memories about the room next door, where a total of six of them – five children and their mother – used to sleep. Anka recalled the packed environment. She estimated the room was no bigger than 150 square feet and likened it to the subdivided flats of today. Five of them slept on a double bed made bigger by a wooden board, while their eldest brother would sleep on a camp bed, she said. The set up made entering and exiting the room a challenge. 'Basically past evening time, we would not leave the bedroom. We would place a spittoon inside,' Anka said with a laugh, implying that the metal container would have been used as a makeshift toilet if necessary. One of the perks of living on a dairy farm was being able to taste fresh milk. The Dairy Farm Company was founded by Scottish surgeon Patrick Manson in the 19th century 'to provide a regular supply of hygienic fresh milk for Hong Kong people' and 'to reduce the price of cow's milk so as to make it affordable by the city's growing population,' according to an Antiquities Advisory Board document. The farm at Pokfulam occupied a 120 hectare hilly site that was initially home to a herd of 80 cows, later growing to more than 1,000 animals. During the Japanese occupation, milk was reserved for Japanese consumption and cattle were shipped to mainland China. In the post war years, the government acquired land around the farm to build vast housing estates, and by the 1980s, dairy farming had fallen out of official favour. 'The milk we drank was usually 'first hand' because it was brought to the manager for tasting right after milking and sterilisation. We usually benefited from that,' Wa Nui recalled. The milk was so good that the sisters would mix it with rice and call it a meal. 'Sometimes we snuck out to play and came home late. We would be given a plain bowl of rice – no other food – as punishment. So we thought of adding some milk to go with it and [found out] it was actually quite tasty,' Anka recalled. When asked if they grew tired of dairy products, the sisters were quick to say no. There were fewer choices of snacks back in the day, they said. 'Sometimes our mum would make cake with it,' Anka said. 'And there was something she would knock up – I don't quite know what that was – but she would heat the milk until it was viscous, then add some sugar to it and make it almost like a paste. That was really yummy.' After years of training their palettes with fresh milk, both women agreed that the dairy products nowadays taste much blander; 'like drinking water,' as they put it. It was not only the milk itself but the experience of living on a farm that added to their perceptions. 'We saw how the cows were raised, how the workers cleaned them, fed them and herded them,' said Anka, who like her sister is now in her late 50s. 'Compared to other people, we witnessed the whole process of a calf growing and becoming a cow, being raised and eventually being milked  So we cherished every single drop of milk and would not waste any.' The sisters' childhood home was abandoned and left unattended for more than two decades before receiving its Grade I historic building status in 2009. A decade later, The Pokfulam Farm revitalisation project run by NGO Caritas Hong Kong and a group of Pokfulam villagers began, subsidised through a government scheme to conserve heritage buildings. Wa Nui, who has lived in Pokfulam village since the farm ceased operation, is a part of a group called Lok Gun Yuen that co organises workshops for visitors to the farm to learn more about the village and its traditions. 'For Pokfulam villagers, the Dairy Farm company carried a lot of memories. Many of them grew up here when the farm was in operation. Some may have family members who worked for the company, or they played near the farm, as if it was their backyard,' said Hazyl Lam, the heritage and business development manager at The Pokfulam Farm. Lam said she hoped The Pokfulam Farm could act as a gateway to get people interested in the history of the village, as well as the area's cultural landscape. One of the hardest parts of revitalising the century old buildings was achieving a balance between keeping the original structure and making alterations to ensure they met present day regulations. Trying to recreate the main building's original hip roof was the biggest challenge. Lam said the building had a flat roof for years, but old documents and photos suggested the initial design was a tiled hip roof. To meet the requirement under Buildings Department legislation, multiple steel bars were added for support. Although the additional structure did not blend that well with the classic interiors, it was a compromise that had to be made. Another major additional structure was an accessible entrance for wheelchair users, which Lam said 'accidentally became a hot spot for watching and photographing the sunset.' For the Tam sisters, it means a lot that a part of their childhood is being preserved. 'At first, I thought this place was going to be torn down because it was sealed off  Once I learned that it would be conserved, I was so happy. I could not describe my excitement. Because what I experienced there while I was young can be passed on and learned by the next generation,' Anka said. Wa Nui, meanwhile, hoped Hongkongers would cherish the heritage people fought so hard to protect. 'In Hong Kong, many things were torn down [to make way for development]. When everything is gotten rid of, it is gone forever. But now, these things have been [preserved] for people to see,' Wa Nui said. 'It's just quite fun to do this together as a group, so I kept doing it,' she said, referring to her work with Lok Gun Yuen. 'It made me feel like I helped a little, so that's nice.' The Pokfulam Farm had its soft opening in April, offering limited guided tours and workshops. Its official opening is slated for later this year.

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/10/15/84-year-old-lung-wah-hotel-presses-on-amid-covid-induced-closures-of-storied-hong-kong-eateries/;2022-10-15 10:00:00+08:00; 84 year old Lung Wah Hotel presses on amid Covid induced closures of storied Hong Kong eateries;" Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit Nestled in a quaint Sha Tin village that overlooks trains rumbling along their tracks, Hong Kong's historic Lung Wah Hotel has weathered many storms. It survived the Japanese occupation in the early 1940s, when part of the site served as a base for soldiers. Decades later, it was forced to halt its hotel operations after the government said it had breached fire safety regulations, leaving only its restaurant. And when SARS hit in 2003, Lung Wah had to rethink how to continue serving its signature dish – roasted pigeons – as authorities banned the live slaughter of poultry. The Covid 19 pandemic, however, almost proved too much. Mary Chung, the managing director of Lung Wah Hotel, said she had to sell a home six months ago because she owed her staff several months' salary. Sensing that the 84 year old business was on its last legs, property giants approached Chung and offered to buy the land for hefty sums. 'We considered the offers as a last resort, in case we were in really dire straits and couldn't make it,' Chung told HKFP on an October afternoon as she took a break from helping out in the kitchen. 'It would be quite lucrative [for companies] to build luxury high rises here. Big pieces of land like this in Sha Tin are rare,' she said. Thankfully for Lung Wah, it has not reached that point, yet. Instead, the Hong Kong icon is pressing on in a city that has seen a number of its oldest, most recognised dining establishments collapse recently under Covid 19. Jumbo Floating Restaurant in Aberdeen, which shut indefinitely in March 2020, was towed away in June after failing to find a new operator before capsizing in the South China Sea. The century old Lin Heung Tea House in Central closed in August, saying it was 'defeated by the pandemic.' When HKFP visited during a mid week lunchtime, soon after the government relaxed Covid related social distancing rules to allow 12 people per table, Lung Wah Hotel's main dining room was around three quarters occupied. Its round tables teemed with roasted pigeon, fried noodles, stir fry vegetables and other traditional Cantonese style dishes, and the light chatter of customers filled the air. Two other dining rooms, however, lay unused. Their lights remained on for customers to wander in and take photos of the faded Bruce Lee printouts that decorate their walls; the late actor was said to have been a frequent visitor of the restaurant. Founded in 1938 by the wealthy Chung family, Lung Wah Hotel is now in the hands of the second generation. Mary, who is married to the 92 year old heir Chung Kam ling, shuttles between Switzerland, where her husband lives, and Hong Kong, overseeing the restaurant's operations when she is in the city. The space also has a garden with a water feature, a small children's playground, event spaces and a miniature menagerie, home to two peacocks and a giant turtle. Armando Lai, the restaurant's spokesperson, told HKFP that Lung Wah Hotel had been struggling since mid 2019, when protests against a proposed amendment to the city's extradition bill broke out. Sha Tin became a flashpoint during the months long unrest, deterring customers from coming and companies from holding their annual dinners there. Business nosedived further as Covid 19 hit. 'During some lunchtimes, there were literally no customers,' he said. 'The worst months was when the government banned dining in after 6 p.m.' Food delivery offered a lifeline for many of Hong Kong's floundering restaurants, but Lai said Lung Wah Hotel did not have much success on delivery platforms, perhaps due to its higher price points. The restaurant's clientele also skews older and are less likely to be regular users of those platforms. Its remote location – uphill and in a village almost 20 minutes' walk from Sha Tin MTR station – also made it an unwelcome choice for takeaway, he added. Lai said the restaurant slashed its full time staff count by more than half – retaining a bare bones team of waiters, kitchen workers and a head cleaner – while some workers in their sixties and seventies retired. Everybody else is part time, coming and going per the needs of the restaurant. 'Our head pigeon chef was put on unpaid indefinite leave,' Lai said. 'We still haven't asked him to come back.' After almost three years of strict Covid 19 restrictions, Hong Kong is picking up the pace in rolling back some of its strictest measures. The city's authorities have stressed that Hong Kong is on a 'path to normalcy,' and Chief Executive John Lee is expected to announce a clearer roadmap in his policy address on Wednesday. Over the past month, the government has axed the mandatory hotel quarantine rule for incoming travellers, allowed cruises to restart and ended a ban on live music in bars that had been in place for over two years. Chung and Lai believe that after riding out on again, off again evening dine in bans and a cap on two, four, eight and now 12 diners per table since Covid 19 began, the restaurant's darkest days are behind them. Business has taken a positive turn since groups of 12 have been allowed to eat together, they said, while recent media reports on the restaurant's challenges during the pandemic have given them a much needed publicity boost. 'The restaurant is hiring some full time staff again now that it's getting busier,' Lai said. He added that as measures are relaxed further, Lung Wah Hotel hoped to bring back some of the activities it used to hold before 2019 – including tours of the restaurant's farm around 10 minutes' walk away and workshops about cultural preservation. Chung said that during the toughest months, the offers from development companies were tempting. 'Wouldn't it be great? We'd have this big sum of money and we wouldn't have to struggle anymore.' 'But are always making new memories here. There's so much we would miss,' she said. 'Like just yesterday, there were some deaf customers who came who were non verbal,' she added. 'They kept making hand gestures and we thought they wanted to take pictures.' 'Then we realised they were giving us a thumb up, telling us to fight on. This encouragement means a lot.'

Many of the museum goers skew young, and they appear excited to see one exhibit in particular – Ghosts and Hell: The Underworld in Asian Art. The installation invites visitors to tour the East Asian and Southeast Asian afterlife as imagined by Buddhism and folk religion through paintings, sculpture, film, and mixed media. Even before the exhibit officially opened in June, it was clear it was going to be a success, with images of its Chinese 'zombies' display going viral online, generating 101,000 Facebook 'likes' and 51,000 comments. Three months in, the museum has sold more than 200,000 tickets with final numbers to be tallied when it closes on October 16. Special ticketing arrangements have been in force to ensure visitors get equal opportunity to wander through the 'gates of hell' or examine amulets to ward off evil spirits. 'I think it's [so popular] because in our childhood, we watch a lot of horror movies from China, or Hong Kong or Japan, and we have a huge emotional connection to zombies,' says Chi Lien, a member of the museum's education department, as he takes HKFP around the exhibition. 'Most people found it very cool that this was the first time they could see such things in an art museum.' The zombies, museum exhibition designer Chen Han yang later explains, came from the Chinese custom of 'corpse walking' to help bring the dead home. In places like Hunan, a mountainous province in southern China, carrying the bodies was challenging. Transporters would tie them upright with their arms attached to bamboo poles – which made them look like reanimated corpses walking with outstretched limbs. The practice would enter folklore – and later horror cinema — as a jiangshi vampire zombie. Many of the items from the show come from the Musée du Quai Branly – Jacques Chirac in Paris, which originally commissioned the exhibit back in 2018. Tainan Art Museum has added nine pieces from Taiwanese artists and another 16 from other local museums and private collections. For this reason, the Tainan exhibition is more East Asian than its original version, with the additions bringing a greater sense of terror. One of these newly commissioned mixed media pieces, Hell by Taiwanese artist Yan Chung Hsien, greets visitors to the exhibition with a Dante like entrance. On the wall behind a seated deity are the the words: 'Here you are.' The sound of bees echoes in the entryway from an unsettling video installation nearby, also entitled Hell, depicting creepy shots of religious objects and temple displays. 'It's kind of like the last judgment. There is the god Yan Wang who is going to judge you: what you have done, before when you were alive, now he needs to see if you are a good person or not,' according to Chiou. The theme of judgment is everywhere in the exhibition, which features rare historic paintings depicting the 10 kings of diyu, the Chinese version of hell, as well as a vision of its Buddhist counterpart, Naraka, by contemporary Thai artist Preecha Rachawong. These make way, in turn, for artwork themed around wandering ghosts, from Japanese woodblock prints of mournful female spirits to a terrifying sculpture of the krasue or ahp – among other names – of Southeast Asian folklore embodied as the floating head of a woman connected to dangling internal organs and nothing else below. The exhibition gets lighter as it moves through later rooms, with more playful examples of Thai and Japanese horror film posters, visually lighter and less terrifying artwork, and a stunning ceramic sculpture of joss paper seemingly floating in the air by Taiwanese artist Hou Chun ting. Other highlights include rainbow coloured costumes and masks from northern Thailand's Phi Ta Khon ghost festival, which are beautiful albeit unsettling. Both informative and visually arresting, the exhibition has captured something of the Taiwanese spirit. The island has long loved a good ghost story or scary film as seen in the recent success of Netflix's Incantation or 2019's Detention, which drew inspiration from Taiwan's authoritarian past as much as its ghost culture. Exhibition designer Chen speculates visitors may also have been drawn to the Tainan Art Museum as anti epidemic measures began to subside over the summer, just in time for school holidays. The museum, which opened in late 2018, is also conveniently situated by other hotspots in Tainan, the cultural capital of Taiwan and home to remnants of 17th century Dutch and Chinese colonisation efforts. Indeed sitting outside Ghosts and Hell, among the clusters of youngsters, HKFP speaks to a group of grandmothers who were in Tainan for the day from the southern port city of Kaohsiung to see the exhibit. One woman surnamed Huang, said that she originally had no interest in the show until her grandson convinced her to visit, even though she usually prefers historic spots like the nearby Dutch fort at Anping. 'The kids all find this more interesting, older people just see them as worship or prayer items, we're not as interested,' the woman said, adding that she was less afraid of the exhibit's amulets and masks because she identifies as Christian. Another visitor, Navi Wu, who identifies as indigenous Paiwan Taiwanese, told HKFP she visited the exhibit after viewing another show on Canadian and Taiwanese indigenous art on the museum's lower level. Wu said she could see many parallels between Japanese and Taiwanese ghost culture, which absorbed 50 years of influence during Japanese colonial rule from 1895 until 1945. 'I think Japanese culture is interesting, and its culture is similar to [that of] Taiwan,' she said. 'The ghosts are quite interesting, but they can be destructive.'

https://hongkongfp.com/2022/10/08/explainer-hong-kong-chief-executive-john-lees-first-100-days-in-office/;2022-10-08 10:00:00+08:00; : Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee's first 100 days in office; Hong Kong Free Press HKFP Hong Kong news – Independent, impartial, non profit Saturday marks 100 days since John Lee was inaugurated by China's leader Xi Jinping at a closely guarded ceremony after running uncontested for the position. Proclaiming that Hong Kong had managed to 'restore order from chaos' since the enactment of the Beijing imposed national security law, the new chief executive inherited a 'patriots only' legislature from his predecessor, and a largely muted opposition. HKFP rounds up the achievements and shortcomings of Lee's tenure since July 1. Onerous Covid 19 travel restrictions, including flight bans and compulsory quarantine, have been scrapped after intense criticism from the business sector and a warning from the financial chief of a potential HK$100 billion deficit – the city's second ever highest. Hong Kong had long maintained one of the world's strictest quarantine requirements for incoming travellers, lasting for 21 days at one point. Although the compulsory hotel quarantine has been axed, inbound travellers must still undergo three days of medical surveillance, and take four PCR tests within a week after arrival. During the surveillance period, they are banned from premises such as restaurants or bars which are subject to the Vaccine Pass scheme. For many business owners and lawmakers, the relaxation was seen as too little too late, with many calling for the scrapping of the surveillance period. The confirmation of an international banking summit scheduled for November has been seen as a sign that Hong Kong is moving towards unrestricted international travel.Legislative Councillor Michael Tien said the '0+0' model – a complete scrapping of travel restrictions – must be implemented for Hong Kong to regain its competitiveness. The city's reputation has been dealt a heavy blow by its strict Covid 19 prevention policies, with Singapore overtaking Hong Kong in international rankings as businesses and exhibitions moved away from the city. However, the chief executive has said that 'Hong Kong's competitiveness still exists.' Lee is set to make his first Policy Address in mid October. As parties and lawmakers submit proposals, the chief executive is expected to announce a clearer 'path to normalcy' for the city. Local social distancing rules largely remain in place, for now at least. While restaurants are currently allowed to seat up to 12 people at a table, people are only allowed to gather outside in groups no larger than four. Lee's administration has stepped up vaccination efforts by expanding the Vaccine Pass scheme to children as young as five, who must now receive at least one jab before they can enter premises including restaurants, theme parks, and libraries. Hong Kong is one of the few places in the world which requires kids to receive Covid 19 vaccinations. The World Health Organization lists healthy children in the 'lowest priority' group when it comes to Covid 19 jabs. The Hong Kong Committee on Children's Rights has criticised the government's decision and said it 'raises serious concerns for children's rights and welfare.' Lee's administration has also cracked down on false vaccine exemption certificates, identifying seven doctors who allegedly issued the documents without prior diagnosis. Six were arrested last month, and over 20,000 certificates will soon be invalidated. Legislator Doreen Kong has questioned the legal basis of the government's decision, and said that she 'cannot stand' to see the government implementing such an 'imperious' measure in a society governed by the rule of law. As per his campaign promises, Lee has set up four task forces targeting issues ranging from public housing to inter generational poverty. Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration Cheuk Wing hing became the hygiene campaign leader, as Lee followed in the footsteps of his predecessors Tung Chee hwa and Leung Chun ying in launching a clean up. Clean up teams have cleared away obstructions such as old motorbikes on pavements, but a survey by pro Beijing group New Youth Forum published last month showed that over 40 per cent of respondents lacked confidence in the government's efforts on public hygiene. The Strive and Rise Programme, a mentoring scheme designed to help lift adolescents out of intergenerational poverty, is another of Lee's projects. The programme, led by Chief Secretary for Administration Eric Chan, aims to pair 2,000 students from poverty stricken homes with mentors. Applications closed last month but the Labour and Welfare Department, when asked by legislative councillors, did not disclose the number of people seeking to take part. Questions were also raised over the scheme's practicality, with New People's Party lawmaker Regina Ip saying that grassroots families often lacked time and resources. She questioned what impoverished students could learn from meeting 'star mentors' such as the city's Olympic medallists and touring elite sports training facilities. During Lee's first 100 days, the city saw several grave accidents, with some raising serious concerns over industrial safety standards. In July, two dancers were hit by a large falling screen while performing at a concert by popular Hong Kong boy band Mirror. While the government was praised for its initial swift response in suspending the remaining shows and inspecting the arena, the administration has yet to deliver on its promise of an investigation report. Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said on Thursday the investigation was 'drawing to a close,' and the results of the official probe would be announced as soon as possible. Another investigation was launched after a crane collapsed at a construction site in Sau Mau Ping, Kwun Tong last month, killing three people and injuring six others. Sun said that investigation was still ongoing. In his election manifesto, Lee promised to set 'key performance indicators' for specific areas within his first 100 days. The former senior police officer also pledged to submit initial suggestions on speeding up the building of public housing in the same timeframe. However, no public announcements have yet been made on either matter. A planned public housing development at Fanling golf course hit an obstacle in August when and environmental advisory body asked the government to provide more information before it could approve a report related to the project. The move could delay discussions on the development by at least seven months.

A Hong Kong man protesting peacefully outside the Chinese consulate in the northern city was dragged into the premises by unidentified men who came out of the consulate, the BBC reported. The protester escaped with the help of the police and other protesters. According to a video circulating on social media, a man kicked down protest signs erected outside the consulate that read, 'may the higher power destroy the Chinese communist [party], screw the celebration,' before returning to the compound. Another view of the beating whilst police look on failing to intervene with speed and determination. pic.twitter.com/OAxnKt1RMT Additionally, flags that read 'Hong Kong independence,' and 'liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times,' were displayed outside the consulate. The latter was a popular refrain during the protests and unrest in 2019 and has been ruled to be capable of inciting others to commit secession. Footage from the BBC showed a picture of China's leader Xi Jingping with a noose around his neck was displayed, too. Some of the men who could be seen punching and kicking the protester inside the consulate grounds were wearing protective gear, such as helmets and vests. The man who was beaten up, who identified himself as 'Bob,' told the BBC that the incident was 'ridiculous.' 'Your so called Hong Kong government said that we are rioters, but now your government, Chinese people, what are they doing? Who really is the rioter here?' Bob told the BBC. British Members of Parliament, including former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith, as well as Catherine West and Alicia Kearns, urged the Foreign Office and the home secretary to investigate the incident. 'The CCP will not import their beating of protestors and denial of free speech to British streets,' Kearns' post on Twitter read. 'Chinese Ambassador should be summoned & if any official has beaten protesters, they must be expelled or prosecuted.' The Chinese consulate, in response to the BBC, criticised the protesters as 'a small bunch of Hong Kong independence advocates,' and said that no consulate would tolerate people displaying images that insult Xi. ''This would be intolerable and unacceptable for any diplomatic and consular missions of any country. Therefore, we condemn this deplorable act with strong indignation and firm opposition,' the consulate told the BBC. Pro Beijing protesters have often wielded effigies of foreign leaders at overseas consulates in Hong Kong. The Greater Manchester Police told the BBC that there were ongoing enquiries over the incident.

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/10/17/uk/manchester-chinese-consulate-protesters-intl-hnk/index.html;2022-10-18 05:00:00; Hong Kong protester allegedly beaten at Chinese consulate in UK; Police in Manchester have launched an investigation after a Hong Kong pro democracy protester was allegedly beaten on the grounds of the Chinese consulate in the English city. A pro democracy group called Hong Kong Indigenous Defence Force had staged a protest outside the consulate in the northern city on Sunday, in opposition to the Chinese Communist Party Congress happening the same day in Beijing. Video of the incident shared widely on social media shows a confrontation breaking out on the sidewalk outside the consulate, with loud shouts heard as people rush towards the gated entrance. The video then appears to show one Hong Kong protester being dragged through the gate into the consulate grounds and beaten by a group of men. The video appears to show local police entering the grounds of the consulate to break up the violence. Hong Kong Indigenous Defence Force alleges that Chinese consular staff were involved in the alleged beating, and that the protester was taken to hospital in stable condition. Greater Manchester Police said Monday they were investigating the incident, in which a man 'suffered several physical injuries.' 'We understand the shock and concern that this incident will have caused not just locally, but for those much further afield who may have connections with our communities here in Greater Manchester,' assistant chief constable Rob Potts said in a statement. 'Shortly before 4 p.m. a small group of men came out of the building and a man was dragged into the Consulate grounds and assaulted. Due to our fears for the safety of the man, officers intervened and removed the victim from the Consulate grounds.' 'The man – aged in his 30s – suffered several physical injuries and remained in hospital overnight for treatment. He is continuing to receive our support for his welfare.' The statemented added that currently 'no arrests have been made' and that the investigation was ongoing. A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Liz Truss described the incident as 'deeply concerning.' On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said he was 'not aware of the situation.' 'Chinese Embassy and consulates in the UK have always abided by the laws of the countries where they are stationed,' he said in a regular news briefing. 'We also hope that the British side, in accordance with the provisions of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, will facilitate the normal performance of the duties of the Chinese Embassy and consulates in the UK.' CNN approached the Chinese Embassy in London for comment but did not receive an immediate response. Video of the scuffle has been shared online by multiple UK lawmakers, who have called for an investigation into the alleged involvement of Chinese consular staff. 'The UK Government must demand a full apology from the Chinese Ambassador to the UK and demand those responsible are sent home to China,' ruling Conservative Party lawmaker Iain Duncan Smith wrote on Twitter. Conservative Party member of Parliament Alicia Kearns also tweeted on Sunday that authorities 'need to urgently investigate,' and that the Chinese Ambassador should be summoned. 'If any official has beaten protesters, they must be expelled or prosecuted,' she wrote. Both lawmakers have previously been vocal critics of the Chinese Communist Party. Prominent Hong Kong activists have also spoken out. Nathan Law, a former lawmaker and pro democracy figure who fled to the UK in 2020, tweeted: 'If the consulate staff responsible are not held accountable, Hong Kongers would live in fear of being kidnapped and persecuted.' He urged the British government to 'investigate and protect our community and people in the UK.' Britain is home to large numbers of Hong Kong citizens, many of whom left the territory following the introduction of a sweeping national security law in 2020 that critics say stripped the former British colony of its autonomy and precious civil freedoms, while cementing Beijing's authoritarian rule. According to an online statement by organizers of Sunday's protest, around 60 demonstrators had gathered outside the Manchester consulate to protest 'the re election of Xi Jinping.' The Chinese Communist Party Congress, a twice a decade leadership reshuffle and meeting of the party's top officials, kicked off on Sunday. Chinese leader Xi, who came to power in 2012, is widely expected to break with convention and take on a third term, paving the way for lifelong rule. © 2022 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/10/15/china/china-party-congress-opening-day-intl-hnk/index.html;2022-10-16 23:56:00; China's Xi opens Party Congress with speech tackling Taiwan, Hong Kong and zero Covid; Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Sunday vowed to steer China through grave challenges toward national rejuvenation, advancing a nationalistic vision that has put it on a collision path with the West. Speaking at the opening of the 20th Party Congress, where he is poised to secure a norm breaking third term in power, Xi struck a confident tone, highlighting China's growing strength and rising influence under his first decade in power. But he also repeatedly underscored the risks and challenges the country faces. Describing the past five years as 'highly unusual and extraordinary,' Xi said the ruling Communist Party has led China through 'a grim and complex international situation' and 'huge risks and challenges that came one after another.' The very first challenges Xi listed were the Covid 19 pandemic, Hong Kong and Taiwan — all of which he claimed China had come away from victorious. The Chinese government, Xi said, had 'protected people's lives and health' from Covid, turned Hong Kong from 'chaos to governance,' and carried out 'major struggles' against 'independence forces' in the island of Taiwan, a self governing democracy Beijing claims as its own territory despite having never controlled it. Wen Ti Sung, a political scientist with the Australia National University's Taiwan Studies Program, said Xi's decision to flag the Taiwan issue early on in his speech was a departure from previous speeches and conveys a 'newfound urgency on making progress on the Taiwan issue.' Xi won the loudest and longest applause from the nearly 2,300 handpicked delegates inside the Great Hall of the People when he spoke about Taiwan again later in the speech. He said China would 'strive for peaceful reunification' — but then gave a grim warning, saying 'we will never promise to renounce the use of force and we reserve the option of taking all measures necessary.' 'The wheels of history are rolling on towards China's reunification and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Complete reunification of our country must be realized,' Xi said to thundering applause. Xi also underscored the 'rapid changes in the international situation' — a thinly veiled reference to the fraying ties between China and the West, which have been further strained by Beijing's tacit support for Moscow following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He said China has 'taken a clear cut stance against hegemonism and power politics' and 'never wavered' in opposition to unilateralism and 'bullying' — in an apparent jab at what Beijing views as a US led world order that needs to be dismantled. Laying out broad directions for the next five years, Xi said China would focus on 'high quality education' and innovation to 'renew growth' in the country's crisis hit economy. China will 'speed up efforts to achieve greater self reliance in science and technology,' he said, in comments that come just months after his damaging crackdown on the country's private sector and major tech companies. Xi also vowed to speed up efforts to build the People's Liberation Army (PLA) into a 'world class military,' pledging to improve the PLA's ability to safeguard national sovereignty and build strategic deterrence. He also urged the PLA to strengthen its training and improve its 'ability to win.' Xi's speech was peppered with the Chinese term for 'security' — which was mentioned about 50 times. He called national security the 'foundation of the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,' and urged enhancing security in military, economy and 'all aspects,' both at home and abroad. Another point of focus was Marxism and ideology. 'I don't think there will be any relaxation of the ideological atmosphere in the coming five years,' said Victor Shih, an expert on elite Chinese politics at the University of California. Dali Yang, a political scientist at the University of Chicago, said the directions laid out in Xi's opening speech were a continuation of his previous policies. By emphasizing the challenges and struggles, he said, it justifies 'the need for a strong party and its great leader.' The week long congress kicked off on Sunday morning amid heightened security, escalated zero Covid restrictions and a frenzy of propaganda and censorship. The Communist Party's most consequential meeting in decades, the congress is set to cement Xi's status as the China's most powerful leader since late Chairman Mao Zedong, who ruled until his death aged 82. It will also have a profound impact on the world, as Xi doubles down on an assertive foreign policy to boost China's international clout and rewrite the US led global order. A sense of crisis has defined Xi's rule. It will shape China well into the future The meetings will be mostly held behind close doors throughout the week. When delegates reemerge at the end of the congress next Saturday, they will conduct a ceremonial vote to rubber stamp Xi's work report and approve changes made to the party constitution — which might bestow Xi with new titles to further strengthen his power. The delegates will also select the party's new Central Committee, which will hold its first meeting the next day to appoint the party's top leadership — the Politburo and its Standing Committee, following decisions already hashed out behind the scenes by party leaders before the congress. The congress will be a major moment of political triumph for Xi, but it also comes during a period of potential crisis. Xi's insistence on an uncompromising zero Covid policy has fueled mounting public frustration and crippled economic growth. Meanwhile, diplomatically, his 'no limits' friendship with Russian President Vladimir Putin has further strained Beijing's ties with the West following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. In the lead up to the congress, officials across China drastically ramped up restrictions to prevent even minor Covid outbreaks, imposing sweeping lockdowns and increasingly frequent mass Covid tests over a handful of cases. Yet infections caused by the highly transmissible Omicron variant have continued to flare. On Saturday, China reported nearly 1,200 infections, including 14 in Beijing. Public anger toward zero Covid came to the fore Thursday in an exceptionally rare protest against Xi in Beijing. Online photos showed two banners were unfurled on a busy overpass denouncing Xi and his policies, before being taken down by police. Anger at China's zero Covid policy is rising, but Beijing refuses to change course 'Say no to Covid test, yes to food. No to lockdown, yes to freedom. No to lies, yes to dignity. No to cultural revolution, yes to reform. No to great leader, yes to vote. Don't be a slave, be a citizen,' one banner reads. 'Go on strike, remove dictator and national traitor Xi Jinping,' read the other. The Chinese public have paid little attention to the party's congresses in the past – they have no say in the country's leadership reshuffle, or the making of major policies. But this year, many have pinned their hopes on the congress to be a turning point for China to relax its Covid policy. A series of recent articles in the party's mouthpiece, however, suggest that could be wishful thinking. The People's Daily hailed zero Covid as the 'best choice' for the country, insisting it is 'sustainable and must be followed.' On Sunday, Xi defended his highly contentious and economically damaging zero Covid policy. 'In responding to the sudden outbreak of Covid 19, we prioritized the people and their lives above all else, and tenaciously pursued dynamic zero Covid policy in launching all out people's war against the virus,' he said. Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, said Xi's words signaled it is 'impossible for China to change the zero Covid strategy in the near future.' © 2022 Cable News Network.

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/10/10/media/elon-musk-china-taiwan-intl-hnk/index.html;2022-10-12 05:28:00; Elon Musk's unsolicited idea for Taiwan welcomed by Beijing, slammed in Taipei; Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News As tensions between China and Taiwan simmer at their highest point in decades, officials in both places have clashed in recent days over an unsolicited idea from billionaire Elon Musk. The world's richest man suggested in an interview that hostilities between the two could be resolved if Taipei handed some control of the democratically governed island to Beijing, prompting praise from China and predictable outrage in Taiwan. 'My recommendation   would be to figure out a special administrative zone for Taiwan that is reasonably palatable, probably won't make everyone happy,' Musk told the Financial Times in an interview published on Friday. 'And it's possible, and I think probably, in fact, that they could have an arrangement that's more lenient than Hong Kong.' China's ambassador to the United States, Qin Gang, thanked Musk for his suggestion in a tweet Saturday, calling for 'peaceful unification and one country, two systems.' But Taiwan's representative to the US, Bi khim Hsiao, wrote: 'Taiwan sells many products, but our freedom and democracy are not for sale.' China's ruling Chinese Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never governed it, and has long vowed to 'reunify' the island with the Chinese mainland, by force if necessary. Taiwan, a democracy of 23 million people, strongly objects to Beijing'sclaims to the island. Beijing has offered Taiwan a 'one country, two systems' system of governance, similar to Hong Kong, but that has been rejected by all of the island's mainstream political parties and the proposal has received very little public support. In a briefing on October 7, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the 'Taiwan question is China's internal affair.' 'China's position on resolving the Taiwan question is consistent and clear. We remain committed to the basic principle of peaceful reunification and 'one country, two systems,'' she said. 'At the same time, we will resolutely defeat attempts to pursue the 'Taiwan independence' separatist agenda, push back interference by external forces, and safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity.' 'No room for compromise' on Taiwan's sovereignty, President Tsai says in National Day speech Wang Ting yu, a senior lawmaker for Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party, slammed Musk in a Facebook post on Saturday. 'Musk's solution is all about victim concessions,' he said. Musk's comments about Taiwan come days after he angered Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for tweeting a 'peace' plan between Russia and Ukraine, proposing that Kyiv permanently cede Crimea to Moscow and hold new referendums in regions annexed by Russia – this time under the supervision of the United Nations. 'Which Elon Musk do you like more?' Zelensky asked his Twitter followers, using the social media platform's poll function. 'One who supports Ukraine,' or 'One who supports Russia.'

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/10/08/asia/superyacht-oligarch-mordashov-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html;2022-10-11 02:48:00; Superyacht linked to Russian billionaire mysteriously shows up in Hong Kong; A megayacht linked to a sanctioned Russian oligarch has dropped anchor in Hong Kong, amid efforts by the West to seize the luxury assets of Russian elites in allied ports as the war in Ukraine drags on. The Nord, a nearly 142 meter (466 foot) yacht that is said to be one of the world's largest, was spotted by CNN on Friday in Hong Kong's waters, just minutes from the central downtown district. The vessel is estimated to be worth at least $500 million and widely believed to belong to Alexey Mordashov, an industrial billionaire, according to a yacht broker who spoke with CNN. The yacht, 1.5 times the size of an American football field, arrived in Hong Kong on Wednesday from the Russian port of Vladivostok, according to the Chinese city's Marine Department. The government agency told CNN on Friday that it hadn't been notified about when the yacht would depart for its next destination. As of Friday afternoon, the Nord was seen flying a Russian flag, with the name of its home base, 'Vladivostok,' emblazoned on its stern. A few people, apparently crew members dressed in uniform, were spotted on the vessel's deck. Mordashov is one of Russia's wealthiest billionaires, with an estimated net worth of $18.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That's down by $10 billion so far this year, according to the wealth tracker. The tycoon is chairman of Severstal, a Russian steel and mining giant that at last count had 54,000 employees across 69 countries. The US State Department sanctioned him and Severstal in June, in addition to three of Mordashov's other companies, his wife and two adult children. In a statement at the time, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the Treasury Department was taking further action to 'degrade the networks allowing Russia's elites, including President [Vladimir] Putin, to anonymously make use of luxury assets around the globe.' JPMorgan forces sale of Russian oligarch's megayacht But the United States isn't the only country cracking down. Several superyachts tied to Russian businessmen have been seized this year in high profile cases around the world, including in Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom. Mordashov has challenged sanctions against him in European courts. In May, he argued that an EU court should annul the decision to add him to a list of those penalized over the Russian invasion of Ukraine, according to European Union filings. 'I have absolutely nothing to do with the emergence of the current geopolitical tension and I do not understand why the EU has imposed sanctions on me,' he said this spring, at the beginning of the war, according to TASS, Russia's state news agency. Hong Kong may provide some refuge. Reached for comment by CNN on Friday, the Hong Kong Marine Department said that it would 'not comment on any individual cases of vessel entry.' The city requires overseas yacht owners to gain permission from authorities to enter, including showing proof of insurance, according to the Marine Department. 'We note that certain countries may impose unilateral sanctions against certain places on the basis of their own considerations,' it said. But the government 'does not implement, nor do we have the legal authority to take action on, unilateral sanctions imposed by other jurisdictions,' the department added, saying only that it would enforce 'sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council.' On Tuesday, Hong Kong leader, Chief Executive John Lee, said the city had 'no legal basis' to act on Western imposed sanctions – referring to the United States– but 'will comply with any United Nations resolution on sanctions.' Lee himself is among nearly a dozen people sanctioned by the US in 2020 for undermining the city's autonomy and democratic processes, to which he described as a 'a very barbaric act' on Tuesday. 'Hong Kong respects the rule of law.As an international financial city, Hong Kong's regulatory system is on par with international standards.We will not do anything that has no legal basis,' Lee said. Russia and China — of which Hong Kong is a part — are two of the five members on the Security Council with veto power. Russia has consistently vetoed resolutions on the council in recent months, impeding action on Ukraine. Severstal did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Mordashov on Friday. MarineTraffic, the global maritime analytics provider, shows that the Nord arrived in Hong Kong this week after a seven day journey through the Sea of Japan and East China Sea. It's hard to know exactly why the crew chose to come to the Asian hub now, said Michael Maximilian Bognier, a yacht broker with Next Wave Yachting in Hong Kong. But he noted that the port of Vladivostok could get relatively cold in the winter, making it tougher to maintain such a vessel. 'Not [an] ideal climate to keep a boat like that,' Bognier told CNN. Asked whether the lack of sanctions could be a draw, Bognier acknowledged the current political climate wasn't helping. 'This could be a reason why she's here,' he said, referring to the yacht. 'It could be a free ticket.' It's rare to see proof of direct ownership of such lavish vessels. Bognier noted, however, that word usually got around about top industry sales and said it was common knowledge that Mordashov was the owner of the yacht. 'Running a boat this size is almost [like] running a city or a business,' he added. New Russian asset tracker details oligarchs' mansions and yachts The Nord was built by German shipping giant Lürssen. 'This is definitely one of the most iconic yachts,' said Bognier. 'It's got a very flat bow, not unlike an aircraft carrier actually. That's a very distinctive feature about this yacht. So it's very, very difficult, let's say, to mistake it for something else.' Sky high carrying costs could make it tough for even the world's wealthiest to maintain such assets. Bognier estimated that it could range from approximately $45 million to $70 million just to keep the yacht running each year, not factoring in variable costs of fuel or maintenance after any long journeys. That would break down to an average bill of $100,000 to $200,000 a day. The Nord yacht boasts two helipads, and would likely have an extensive staff on board, including a full time chef, fitness instructor, massage therapist, and possibly a helicopter pilot, according to Bognier. 'When we talk about boats this size, these are standard items,' he said. CNN's Wayne Chang, Gianluca Mezzofiore and Josh Pennington contributed to this report. © 2022 Cable News Network.

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/10/09/china/hong-kong-teenagers-national-security-intl-hnk/index.html;2022-10-10 00:02:00; Five Hong Kong teenagers sentenced in first security case involving minors; Five teenagers with a Hong Kong group advocating independence from Chinese rule were ordered by a judge on Saturday to serve up to three years in detention at a correctional facility, for urging an 'armed revolution' in a national security case. The five, some of whom were minors aged between 15 and 18 at the time of the alleged offence, had pleaded guilty to 'inciting others to subvert state power' through a group named 'Returning Valiant.' Sentences for two more, ages 21 and 26, will be delivered at a later date. Justice Kwok Wai kin detailed how the defendants had advocated a 'bloody revolution' to overthrow the Chinese state at street booths, and on Instagram and Facebook after adoption of a sweeping, China imposed national security law. Kwok called the alleged incitement a serious crime, but nevertheless took into account their 'age and immaturity' as he sentenced them to a training center, or detention facility for young people, rather than jail. The length of stay, capped at three years, is left to correctional authorities to decide. 'Even if only one person is incited by them, the social stability of Hong Kong and the safety of residents may be seriously endangered,' Kwok added. 'There's no evidence to directly prove that anyone was incited by the defendants to subvert state power, but this real risk exists.' Hong Kong puts 90 year old cardinal on trial over protest fund Four of the five have already been remanded in custody for more than a year, with only one granted bail. Prosecutors Anthony Chau and Stella Lo earlier told the court that the group's pamphlets mentioned the French and Ukrainian Revolutions as examples of successful armed rebellions, and quoted Mao Zedong on a revolution being 'a violent act of one class overthrowing another'. Prosecutors detailed how the police had seized flags, leaflets, air guns, ammunition and extendable batons in an industrial building. At least 22 people linked to the group were arrested last year. Several face a separate charge of conspiring to commit terrorism under the security law. Authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong say the security law has restored stability to the global financial hub after mass anti government and pro democracy protests in 2019. Human rights experts on the United Nations Human Rights Committee, however, called for the law to be repealed in a July report, amid concerns it is being used to crack down on fundamental freedoms. © 2022 Cable News Network.

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/10/07/business/cathay-pacific-staffing-shortages-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html;2022-10-07 04:32:00; Cathay Pacific is facing 'unprecedented staffing' shortages, warns top union in Hong Kong; Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hong Kong's flagship airline Cathay Pacific is facing 'unprecedented' staff shortages and may not be ready to handle a surge in demand, as the city winds up its strict Covid policy and reopens for international travel. A top local union warned Thursday of 'a record number of resignations from the company's most experienced pilots,' claiming that Cathay 'has lost over 40% of its captains and first officers.' In a statement, the Hong Kong Aircrew Officers Association (HKAOA) said that the carrier was 'unprepared to regain its industry leadership position, threatening the status of Hong Kong as a global aviation hub.' The group cited a breakdown in negotiations on pay, among other working conditions. Hong Kong's flagship airline is 'facing unprecedented staffing and training shortages,' and 'stands unprepared to fully resume its operations, failing to meet demand in a resurgent travel market,' the HKAOA said. Like most airlines, Cathay has been pummeled during the pandemic. Once known as a premier employer, the carrier last year grappled with falling morale, a spike in resignations and mounting frustration as staff underwent Hong Kong's arduous quarantine measures, which were some of the world's strictest. But, this month Hong Kong ended its two and a half years of quarantine measures, leading to a surge in demand for outbound travel. The news brought some much needed relief to Cathay, which was forced to slash capacity to as little as 2% of pre pandemic levels during the global health crisis. In recent weeks, Cathay has said it will add hundreds of new flight services in response to the relaxation of border controls. It even set up a virtual 'waiting room' for its booking website as customers flooded its platform to buy tickets. Now, the company is finding itself on the defense once again as pilots warn of continued workplace issues. When asked for comment Thursday, a Cathay Pacific spokesperson told CNN Business that it 'has sufficient qualified and experienced aviation professionals to continue to support the current operation and operate at the highest levels of safety and customer service.' 'We remain focused on building connectivity between Hong Kong and the world as swiftly as we possibly can. However, it will still take time to rebuild our capacity as we build operational readiness and undertake a substantial amount of training and aircraft reactivation,' the spokesperson said. The company has already started a huge recruitment drive to enlist 'more than 4,000 frontline employees to meet Cathay Pacific's operational needs over the next 18 24 months,' the spokesperson added. 'We believe our contracts for pilots are competitive contracts.' But as Hong Kong reopens after the pandemic other airlines are deciding on a different approach. On Wednesday, Virgin Atlantic announced it is closing its Hong Kong office and not resuming services between the Asian hub and London's Heathrow Airport. 'Significant operational complexities due to the ongoing Russian airspace closure have contributed to the commercial decision not to resume flights in March 2023 as planned,' the company said. Flights between London Heathrow and Hong Kong Airport have been paused since December 2021 amid the Covid 19 pandemic. 'We're sorry for the disappointment caused to our loyal customers on this route and anyone booked to travel from March 2023, whose flights will be cancelled,' the company said, adding that customersaffected will be able to amend their flights with no change fee or will be able to request a refund. 'We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused to affected customers,' it said. Wayne Chang in Hong Kong contributed to this report. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/10/07/business/hong-kong-covid-quarantine-reopening-intl-hnk-mic/index.html;2022-10-07 02:13:00; Hong Kong's U turn on quarantine is a sign Beijing still needs its gate to the West;" Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Editor's Note: A version of this story appears in CNN's Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three times a week update exploring what you need to know about the country's rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here. As China doubles down on Covid lockdowns, restricting movement for tens of millions of people, a very different scene is unfolding in Hong Kong. The mood in the Chinese controlled city is perhaps the lightest it has been in three years, after authorities scrapped mandatory hotel quarantine for incoming arrivals in September – prompting a mad rush to book flights out of the city among travel starved residents. It was a significant U turn, given how stubbornly city authorities had stuck to the quarantine requirement, despite a nosediving economy, a worsening international reputation, and an ongoing exodus of residents. Throughout the pandemic, Hong Kong adhered to a stringent 'zero Covid' approach championed by Beijing, which aims to eliminate community transmission using border controls, social distancing measures, electronic track and tracing, and quarantine – which required incoming travelers to isolate in a hotel room for up to three weeks, at their own cost. Hong Kong is opening up to tourism    but is it too late? This approach buckled when Hong Kong was hit by a severe Omicron wave in early 2022, sending case numbers soaring. Numbers have remained high ever since. But despite the ineffectiveness of zero Covid in dealing with fast spreading variants, authorities stood firm for another nine months, emphasizing that their priority was to reopen the border with mainland China. So what changed – and why has Hong Kong been able to do what mainland China hasn't? Experts say there are a few factors at play, such as the relatively stable Covid situation and change in government leadership. But more importantly – it's a bid to ease the dire economic crisis in both Hong Kong and the mainland, and an acknowledgment that despite Beijing's sweeping crackdown in the city, it still needs Hong Kong as a gate to the West. Several experts emphasized that the first and most basic condition for Hong Kong's reopening was the Covid situation itself, with cases having declined to a manageable amount – even if they hover in the thousands per day. 'Given the situation that Hong Kong is nowhere near zero daily cases, I would imagine that there's no possibility of having an open border with the mainland,' said Benjamin Cowling, chair of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). 'And in that case, the only possible choices for Hong Kong are to stay closed to everywhere, or to open at least the international border.' Hong Kong has long prided itself as 'Asia's World City,' a global hub attracting tourists, expatriates and international businesses. Zero Covid has threatened all that, with planes grounded and companies beginning to look elsewhere in Asia. 'If Hong Kong remains closed to international visitors and the rest of the world is open, then Hong Kong will quickly lose its international financial status,' said Vera Yuen, a lecturer of economics at HKU. 'You have to have enough firms, enough talent, resources that come together   It's getting close to the tipping point where we can lose all this.' Hong Kong and Shanghai lose their international luster as Covid restrictions bite Since the start of the pandemic, waves of residents – both expatriates and Hong Kong citizens – have left the city. Around 113,200 residents left Hong Kong over the past year, compared to 89,200 the year before, according to the Census and Statistics Department in August. September brought more bad news, when the city's financial secretary revealed the city could face a budget deficit of over than 100 billion Hong Kong dollars (about $12.7 billion) – which would be the second highest fiscal deficit ever recorded. A spate of upcoming high profile international events added to the growing pressure: the Hong Kong Sevens rugby tournament and the Global Financial Leaders' Forum, which invites executives from the world's biggest financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for a two day summit. According to media reports in August, some banks warned their executives would only attend if there was quarantine free travel – a widely speculated factor behind the government's ultimate decision. It would mark 'a beautiful victory (to have) all the big heads, the superstars from banks, hedge funds, etc. to come to our summit,' said Yuen. 'They're signaling to the world that we're not going to stay like this – we're going back to the competition, don't forget us, we are still a shiny international financial center.' This insistence upon rejoining the international community may appear jarring coming after efforts by Beijing to bring Hong Kong further under its control. Since 2020, the Hong Kong and central governments have all but wiped out the city's opposition. Pro democracy activists have been jailed or exiled, and independent newsrooms shut down; meanwhile, authorities have changed school curricula to emphasize Chinese history and culture, and pushed greater economic cooperation in the Greater Bay Area, a national scheme to link Guangdong province closer with Hong Kong and Macau. But to Beijing, some experts say, it isn't contradictory at all to push Hong Kong as a global hub while integrating it further with the mainland. 'They want both – they don't think it's mutually exclusive,' said Yuen. China's economy is in bad shape and could stay that way for a while As a former British colony that was allowed to retain capitalist freedoms after being handed back to China, Hong Kong has long drawn international businesses hoping to gain access to the Chinese market. Even other Chinese financial centers like Shanghai or Shenzhen have controls over capital flow and information censorship – meaning 'China still needs Hong Kong' to bring in foreign investment and capital, said Yuen. Beijing's hope, she said, is that if Hong Kong can become more deeply integrated with China and the Greater Bay Area, its success in the global market can also boost the mainland economy. And China needs all the help it can get right now, with the housing market collapsing, companies struggling with recurring supply chain headaches, and youth unemployment at a record high. Beijing's zero Covid policy is making things worse, with near constant disruptions as different parts of the country go in and out of lockdown like a virus driven whack a mole. Chinese authorities 'see a role for Hong Kong in helping to restore the mainland economy,' said John Burns, Emeritus Professor at HKU. 'This would be another reason why the central government gave the green light to Hong Kong authorities to open the border – and I think that's what happened. Hong Kong has no autonomy to decide things like this on its own.' China bans residents from leaving Xinjiang, just weeks after its last Covid lockdown He added that the U turn reflects a change in perspective from both Hong Kong and Chinese authorities, and an adaptability to the shifting situation. 'Previously they have prioritized the mainland border   (now), they are saying, okay, well, here is a case where China is opening up one port. Let's see what happens. It's an experiment,' he said. But every experiment runs its risks. By waiting so long to reopen, and by cracking down so hard on Hong Kong, authorities have also created a new sense of wariness among international observers, experts say. 'The West may not treat Hong Kong as different from China anymore,' said Yuen. 'Some of the technologies which were recently banned for import to China are now also banned in Hong Kong because they know that if you ship it to Hong Kong, they will be transferred to China. That is one potential barrier or problem that we have – is how much trust the West will still have in Hong Kong.' Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

The MSCI Asia ex Japan Index — which captures 10 major markets across Asia, excluding Japan — has fallen 12.8% so far this month, on track to post the biggest drop since March 2020, when the Covid 19 pandemic had wreaked havoc on global markets. The index is also set to end the third quarter down nearly 14%. Among major stock markets, Hong Kong and South Korea have had the worst month so far, down 14% and 12% respectively. For the quarter, the Hang Seng

(HSI) Index has tumbled 21% so far, headed toward its worst quarter in two decades, according to Refinitiv. Concerns about a global recession and hawkish policies by central banks around the world have weighed on investor sentiment. The US dollar surged to a fresh two decade high on Wednesday against a basket of major counterparts, boosted by the Fed's policy tightening. The soaring greenback has sparked further fears of capital outflows from Asia's emerging markets. There's a 98% chance of a global recession, research firm warns The Chinese yuan hit a record low of 7.2674 against the dollar on the offshore market earlier this week. It rebounded on Thursday after reports of possible central bank intervention. The onshore yuan, which trades in the tightly managed domestic market, bounced back on Friday to 7.11. But the offshore yuan, which trades more freely overseas, fell again on Friday. It traded at 7.108 per dollar around 1:15 a.m. eastern time. The Japanese yen and the Indian rupee also hit all time lows this week. How the United States is exporting inflation to other countries 'The US dollar's one way upward journey continues to drive safe haven flows and keep concerns on Asian equities elevated,' said Manishi Raychaudhuri, head of Asia Pacific Equity Research at BNP Paribas Securities in a research note this week. 'Foreigners continued to sell Asia equities,' said Citi analysts in a separate report on Friday. They noted that Taiwan, Japan, India, and South Korea have seen nearly $5 billion in total foreign outflows this week. China's economy is in bad shape and could stay that way for a while Nevertheless, Raychaudhuri expects some silver linings for Asia. 'Some tailwind for Asian equities is coming in the form of post Covid reopening – in Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan and potentially in China,' he said. There is also some good news from China this week. On Friday, China's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index showed the country's factory activity unexpectedly grew in September, boosted by recent stimulus measures and a fading heat wave, according to a statement by the government. The PMI rose to 50.1 in September, returning to expansion territory after contracting for two straight months. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

https://edition.cnn.com//2022/09/29/business/hong-kong-banking-summit-covid-reopening-intl-hnk/index.html;2022-09-29 02:50:00; Hong Kong wins over Wall Street CEOs after lifting strict Covid rules;" Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hong Kong has finally secured commitments from some of the world's biggest banks to participate in a long awaited summit, as it seeks to reaffirm its status as a global financial hub. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced Thursday that it would welcome executives including Goldman Sachs

(GS) CEO David Solomon, Morgan Stanley

(MS) CEO James Gorman, Standard Chartered

(SCBFF) CEO Bill Winters, and HSBC

(HSBC) CEO Noel Quinn to the city in November. Top executives from UBS

(UBS), BlackRock

(BLK), Blackstone

(BX) and JPMorgan

(JPM) are also on the program, which starts November 2 and includes some 200 attendees. The confirmation comes just days after the city's government lifted some of the planet's strictest Covid quarantine rules after two and a half years. Now, instead of having to isolate in a designated hotel room at their own expense for three nights, business travelers and tourists can base themselves at accommodation of their choosing, as long as they monitor their health for three days, including by taking rapid Covid tests. Under the current rules, travelers are free to move around, although they may not be allowed into restaurants or bars during the first three days of their stay. Airlines add flights to Hong Kong but the aviation hub won't be back to normal anytime soon The summit was announced by Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan in February. But for several months, there was little news about its agenda, prompting speculation that high flying bankers were reluctant to commit to the event if it required them to spend time in mandatory quarantine. Hong Kong's government has given out special exemptions in the past. Last year, JPMorgan

(JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon was allowed to visit the city without such restrictions when he flew to meet the bank's regional chief and local staff. However, the quarantine free arrival of a wealthy outsider sparked public anger at a time when most inbound travelers were required to isolate in hotels at their own expense for up to 21 days. The backlash reached such heights that it forced Hong Kong's then leader, Carrie Lam, to defend Dimon's special dispensation, saying it was in the interest of 'Hong Kong's economy.' As with many people, it's inconvenient for executives to travel to Hong Kong 'when things aren't actually open,' a person working in the city's finance industry told CNN Business. They requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. If anyone were to request a similar exemption to Dimon's, it would be 'very problematic to have two sets of standards – particularly when Hong Kong residents have stepped up over the last two years,' the person added. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon allowed to skip quarantine in Hong Kong Hong Kong is the base for JPMorgan's Asia Pacific headquarters, as well as those of many other financial firms. But it has been hobbled in the last two years by its strict 'zero Covid' policy, leading the international business community to warn of severe economic damage and a mass exodus of talent to rival cities such as Singapore. The strict rules have also led to the relentless questioning of executives such as HSBC's Quinn, who was repeatedly asked on recent earnings calls whether he felt Hong Kong was still a strong banking hub. Now, the conference will be an important part of the city's efforts to show that it's truly reopened for global business. In a statement Thursday, HKMA chief Eddie Yue said that summit delegates would discuss rising interest rate hikes and global inflation, among other topics. 'I am most grateful to our friends who are traveling to attend the summit at a time when some anti epidemic controls remain in place,' he said, noting that 'the latest relaxation of some of the control measures is helpful.' 'We need to make sure they can meet people, do business and build relationships in the kind of business as usual way they expect from a vibrant international city,' Yue added.
